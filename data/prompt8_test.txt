21135	 I have always tried to be a happy person, and over time I have learned that laughter is a key component to my happiness. I have succeeded in being a happy girl most of my life. Even as a baby, I hardly ever cried; I was always laughing and giggling. As I have grown up, I have tried to keep up my happy-go-lucky spirits. Sometimes this was not the case, but that is simply reality. There have been many times in my life where laughter was all that surrounded me. I rely on laughter to keep me close with my friends, and so far, this trust has always came through, and it has worked for me. I often find myself remembering that laughter and happiness is really what life is all about. When I was first born, I didn't cry. I never cried very much as a baby. My mom reminds me of this whenever I ask her about my baby years. As a young kid, I wanted to be a part of everything that surrounded me! I was always looking for laughter and exciting events; I didn't want to miss a beat! My mom would have to take drives just so I could take a nap, and even then, I would hardly ever fell asleep. For if I did, @CAPS1 forbid, I might miss a moment of laughter! If someone else was laughing, I was laughing with them. Sometimes, I had no idea what was going on, or I wondered why what they had said was so funny, but I loved the feeling laughing with other people. I am always reminded of my happy toddler years whenever I look at my baby pictures. I don't have one of those pictures where I am bawling my eyes out, like you might find in most kid's baby pictures. In every baby picture of me, I'm laughing. If I'm not laughing, then there is a wide smile spread from ear to ear! Laughter is what kept me a happy baby! As a preteen, I was still the girl who you would always see laughing and smiling. I sometimes wondered what it felt like to cry because I had never felt that type of feeling before. I was always so caught up in laughter that I never had time to think about the negative. Now, I unfortunately know the feeling of sadness and being upset, and I try incredibly hard to go back to when I didn't know these feelings. Whenever I'm feeling down, I attempt to find laughter in each thing I do. When I attempt this, I can always find laughter, and my spirits are brought back up. My friends are always a place I can go to for a pick me up. Especially @PERSON1, who is my best friend. Every time I am with her, I find myself laughing for one reason or another. @PERSON1 and I have not had the steadiest friendship, but what always brings us close again is laughter. Our fights always end when we find common ground in something funny. Usually, she is the one who finds this, and she makes me laugh. Laughter is what has kept @LOCATION1 and I so close for the past few years. If laughter didn't exist, I can assure you that we would be anything but friends right now! Not long ago, I was in the car with three of my closest friends: @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, and @PERSON2. We were all laughing and singing as loud as we could to one of our favorite songs. I looked over to my friends and saw all of their smiling faces, and I found myself smiling too. I realized then, that laughter is truly what life is all about. Laughter is what has kept me close to all of my peers throughout my life. When I was little, I was gravitated towards those who I had the most fun with, and who I laughed with the most. As I've grown older, that same thinking is still there; I want to be with the people that make me laugh. The older I have gotten, the more I've learned about what I need in a friend. My main criteria is someone who can make me laugh. If I'm with someone with a dry sense of humor, and who doesn't talk at all, then I am going to go find someone who is laughable and hilarious!  Laughter is something that I am extremely thankful for. It has been the key to making me happy for all fifteen years of my life! From when I was a baby, up until now, laughter is what always has been, and what always will be, what my life is all about!	40
21364	"                                           ""Laughter"" Laughter is a very big part of my life. I love to laugh, whether it is about something, at something, about someone, at someone, a funny event, a funny face, or just a funny joke. I heard once that the more you laugh the longer you live; if that is true I'm gonna live forever. I'm going to tell you a story about laughter because it is a big part of my life.  I laugh the most when I am with my family and friends. They are all very funny people that are cracking jokes any chance they get. There hasn't been one family gathering or friend hangout where I didn't laugh. A very funny moment in my life that I will never forget is the time my sister and I were starting to get to know our new step-mom, @CAPS1.We were all playing this game where one person throws a football into a group of people, and whoever catches it gets the amount of points the thrower calls out. We were all getting points left and right; however, @CAPS1 wasn't doing so hot. She came up with a plan that she said would make her win. Actually, it just ended with all of us on the floor crying from laughing so hard. I had thrown the ball and called out ""@NUM1 points!"" @CAPS1 turned around. My eyes opened wide. Shayna screamed in laughter as @CAPS1 had pulled down her pants to moon us. The foot ball hits the grass, as do all of us.We laughed until our stomachs ached and our eyes watered. I really think that moment brought all of us closer together. I believe laughter brings everyone closer together.  My boyfriend and I are very close because we laugh all the time; it is a very big part of our relationship. Just think for a minute. All the emotions that we humans have and deal with on a regular basis, which one is truly universal? We can love, cry, feel hate and disrespect. Most of us have sympathy and empathy, but the one true feeling we humans share with and between another person is a smile along with laughter. If you can give a person a reason to laugh, then you have connected and made a mile into an inch. It's even bigger than that. The internet has provided us in ways to reachout through laughter. Not just in miles, but in counties. You-tube is a social network of laughter. I have put many funny videos on you-tube and watched many that made me laugh. One day I made this video of my friends and I playing @CAPS5. It was so funny I thought I would put it on you-tube. I shared it with my mom who laughed very hard. She shared it with family who shared it with co workers who shared it with there family and friends.They all laughed.Laughter is all around. Laughter can start in one place like @PERSON1 and reach out all the way to @LOCATION1.  Laughter also isn't always a good thing. People can go from laughing at a funny joke to laughing and making fun of a kid on the play ground. Laughter doesn't always feel good, if you're the one being laughed at. I don't like to think of laughed that way. I like to remember all the times I laughed and shared that special moment with a loved one.  Laughter is in my everyday schedule. I would have to write a book in order to tell you all the times that laughter was one element in my life because it happens every day. I enjoy laughter. I hope you do,too."	45
21468	All the great memories that @LOCATION2 and I, spent and shared together when we were really good bestfriends. We were around @NUM1 years old and in @NUM2 through @NUM3 grade. Ofcourse we got older as the years went by, but we had soo many great times together. When ever we hung out, we would always laugh about almost everything, and most of the time we would just never let alot of stupid things get to us. Whenever I needed someone to talk to she would be the one. She went through a life that was almost the same as what I went through in life, and so she knows what I or even she needs to do or say. Even though we would always have lots of fun, we would have our moments and fight, but alwways work things out. We'd always have each others back for everything. I guess what im trying to say is that, two people who are close always have their great needs and feelings, and especially their laughter in the relationship. Here are some times that @LOCATION2 and I shared and spent together that pretty much led up to laughter.I remember in @NUM2 grade, both of us would always try to hang out whenever we could. We were still young so it was hard to do be able to do anything becuase our parents wouldnt let us most the time. Whenever we did though, we would think about random games, and go to different places just to have fun. As we got older though we were trusted more and could do lots more of things, which was a good thing. Then I moved to @LOCATION1, not the greatest thing, but it was for love. What made it better was that she still came over all the time. We would go and pick her up on @DATE1 and then on @DATE2 my mom would drive to school because my mom still went to work there in florence. Every night that she was there we would always stay up. I remember that I would always keep these little hot chocalate packages in my room and after my parents went to bed we'd sneak out to go get hot water for it so that we would have hot chocalate to drink. Some other times we would make coffee so that we could stay up longer. It was hard sometimes because my room was right across from my parents room and at the time I had beads hanging from my door. Fun times trying to keep quiet and not get caught. Sometimes when she came over she would bring all her make up and things so that we could dress each other up. One night we had blind folds on and do each others makeup.	35
20760	" Fourth period, freshman year was the highlight of my entire freshman year. @LOCATION1 was what most people called him, but I simply called him, @CAPS1. So I'll start off with the first semester of ninth grade with physical science, fourth period. I had the first term with my best friend, @PERSON1, @CAPS12 we got to choose our seats, so we sat next to each other in the back, right hand corner of the classroom. We sat there so we could get away with more, like passing notes @CAPS12 talking during class. So one day, while we were passing the notebook of notes, I most have written something that embarrassed her. So I went to grab something out of my backpack, @CAPS12 she took advantage of the situation. So next thing I knew, I was being shoved out of my desk, onto my backpack, on my back. The class got quiet, for he was giving us notes @CAPS12 showing us how to do the assignment. So as we erupted into fits o laughter, I looked at him to see if he was very angry @CAPS12 if he was going to send us outside of the classroom to talk to us. But all @CAPS1 did was look at us, shake his head, laugh a little to himself, @CAPS12 begin talking again. So, we kept laughing, but we were trying to settle down @CAPS12 stop ourselves from laughing. In the second term, @PERSON1 was @CAPS10 in there with me, but I had my friend @CAPS3-@CAPS4, @CAPS5.@CAPS5, @CAPS12 @PERSON2. i was even closer to @CAPS1 then in the first term. So, one day he was teaching us about compounds. So while he was writing down a chart to help us study, he sang out, ""@CAPS7 play the @CAPS8 @CAPS9!"" @CAPS10 even seconds later, the class burst with laughter, even he had to stop from writing he was laughing so hard. It took us about ten minutes to settle down @CAPS12 stop laughing. Another part of the second term that was a fun @CAPS12 a good laugh was doing some example problems on our own. So one of my classmates, @LOCATION2, asked what should we do to tell him we are finished with the problems. So @LOCATION1 thought for a few moments, @CAPS12 said, ""@CAPS11 you finish your problems, cluck like a chicken for me."" @CAPS12 about five minutes afterwords, people started clucking like chickens. @CAPS12 with that, my friends brought up the fact that I own chickens. But as more people were finishing their problems, it was getting annoying. It was hilarious at first though. Then there was @CAPS13 @CAPS14. We had just a regular classroom, @CAPS10 a science @CAPS13, so we were unable to do to many experiments. So @CAPS15, the other science teacher let us borrow her classroom for an entire school @CAPS14, being as her class had an online report to do. @CAPS1 banned me from using the matches, because his nickname for me was @CAPS16-@CAPS17. Then on the final day, he broke about @NUM1 to a dozen glass test tubes. @CAPS11 this happened, i was almost complete with my packet we had to do for the @CAPS14. So I went over to him while he was cleaning up, @CAPS12 I asked what happened. He told me, my classmate broke a bunch of glass test tubes by dropping them. But he looked at me @CAPS11 he did so. So @CAPS11 I looked at him, he started laughing. Which gave his cover away, so i got after him @CAPS12 told him @CAPS10 to blame the children for things he did. especially for breaking the test tubes. There was also the one time I went into his @CAPS18 class to do some homework. My friend wanted me to be there for one day, because she lvoed the class so much. So my guitar lessons teacher allowed me to spend fifth period in that class. So, @CAPS11 he was done giving notes @CAPS12 giving the class their assignment for the day. Some friends of @CAPS3 @CAPS19 called him over for a question. So I looked up from my drawing. By then he was already over to them. So they asked him if he was a swimmer, he replied he did swim. So then they asked if he shaved his legs because he was a swimmer. I think he got embaressed, so he said to come after class @CAPS12 ask personal questions. So they just wanted a yes or no, so he explained, for about five minutes, that they shouldn't waste classtime for silly @CAPS12 personal question about him. I thought the entire time, ""@CAPS20 doesn't he just say yes or no?"" @CAPS21 were fun times that I will never forget @CAPS12 tell the day I die. No class, or science class will ever replace fourth period physical science. Nor any teacher replace @LOCATION1, he is @CAPS12 always will be my favorite teacher. I will forever remember the days of every phsycial science class, because of that one simple teacher."	30
21263	"I could just laugh to death. someone said. I sacned the area. ""@CAPS37?"" I said. ""@CAPS1 here son."" I looked @CAPS1 the stairs leading to @CAPS2 avenue. There was the sorce of the voice i had herd. @CAPS35 was only an old man probualy homeless by the looks of him. He had worn shoes, dirty blue jeans, a riped shirt under a worn jacket. ""@CAPS3, @CAPS31 @CAPS33 a little lost""The old man said. ""@CAPS4, I'm @CAPS73 lost"" said @PERSON1. His pocket started to vibrate. @PERSON1 reached into his pocket an pulled out his cell. He fliped @CAPS35 open and read: @CAPS31 going to be here soon? Tommey typed: ya bro just going onto @CAPS2 ave now. Message sent. @PERSON1 started to climb the steps. ""@CAPS5 @CAPS31 later old man"" said @PERSON1 as he dashed of to meet his friends. @PERSON1 saw his friends in site @CAPS62 were all standing outside of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 bakery. ""@CAPS3,guys @CAPS33 @CAPS35's @PERSON1!"" @CAPS34 @PERSON2. @PERSON2 ran at @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 scuped her @CAPS1 and spun her around one before puting her @CAPS66 @CAPS19. @CAPS62 proceeded to walk over to the group. ""@CAPS37 took @CAPS31 so long dude"" said @CAPS9 @CAPS10. ""@CAPS11, @CAPS63 the short cut i took turned out to be, @CAPS73 to short"" @PERSON1 repiled. ""@CAPS12 don't mind him he's just in a bad mood"" said @CAPS13. ""@CAPS14"" replied @CAPS9 @CAPS10. ""@CAPS3, guys can we go into the @CAPS18 @CAPS19's toy store!!"" inqured @PERSON2. ""@CAPS20 that's fine"" replied @CAPS13 @CAPS22. The group proceeded @CAPS19 @CAPS2 avenue @CAPS24 turned right onto @ORGANIZATION1 street, @CAPS24 another right onto @CAPS25 avenue. The store was located halfway @CAPS19 in the middle of other boutiques. ""@CAPS26 were here"" said @PERSON2 as she spun around around from excitement. ""@CAPS24 let's go in"" said @CAPS9 @CAPS10. ""@CAPS30 old greblin!"" said @PERSON2. ""shh mu ha ha ha"" @CAPS31 got told said @CAPS13. ""@CAPS32"" he grumbled. Once inside the store @CAPS35 was like somone turned @CAPS9 the lights @CAPS9 bright. @CAPS73 only that but the store was filled from top to bottom with @CAPS38 but toys. The toys ranged from small to large to huge. There were all sorts of diffrent types. ""@CAPS33"" @CAPS34 @PERSON2. ""@CAPS35's a @CAPS43 bunny!""""@CAPS35'll smother @CAPS31 in your sleep twerp"" ""@CAPS37's eating @CAPS31?"" said @PERSON1. ""@CAPS38"" grumbbled @CAPS9 @CAPS10. WACK! The bunney conected with @CAPS9 @CAPS10's face. ""@CAPS43 meenie""""@CAPS44, that does @CAPS35"" he took a lion off the shelf and tossed @CAPS35 at @LOCATION2. ""@CAPS3, don't be mean to her!"" said @CAPS13 as she picted @CAPS1 a monester an flung @CAPS35 at @CAPS9 @CAPS10. @CAPS35 missed and hit @PERSON1. @PERSON1 flung @CAPS35 @CAPS66 at @CAPS9 @CAPS10. ""That's @CAPS35"" I @CAPS9 @CAPS10 challege @CAPS31. SMAK. ""@CAPS52"" @CAPS53 this. @CAPS53 that. @CAPS54 @CAPS54 @CAPS31 scum. @CAPS31 can't get me. WAM! Ha ha i'm ausome. TWACK!

21257	" Laughter is one of the most impotent things in life to have around. even if from a simple joke to something that was unbelievable that hap-end to make a grate event in time to share on in history of family members. This helps you threw hard times or just makes somebody day better for them and puts a smile on there face, or gives them a joke to say to somebody else to continue a chain of laughter thew people. Sometimes it can be the most embarrassing thing that people remember about u but in the end the other person that laughs at you for your indecent probably did something like that a long time a go so in the end there laughing at them selves to and don't even realize it. I remember on my fifteenth birthday my grandma toke the hole family out to dinner at a chines restaurant. It was quiet except for the adults discussing what they should order form the family meals. I was siting by me sister looking at a menu just to see what they had to drink, well her mined was on other things because out of no were all u heard was ""they have no fricken chicken"". Every one busted up laughing at her even the waitresses son that was standing behind the both and his mother. It made every ones day because it wasn't the best of days at the time. But u could tell she was embarrassed but laughed at her self to her comment to the table was ""i thought i said it in my head"", i looked at here and said ""no u didn't"" so she just shrugged about it.  To this day when ever we go to a chines restaurant my mom looks at here and ""says they got your fricken chicken""so she looks at here and ""says will that ever die""we all looked at here and said"" no its going to be passed down to your children they'll here about there mothers fricken chicken day"".It was that bad of a indecent that she gets up set that it wont go away but it still gives every one else a laugh. even though it was so long ago that it happened are parents joke that its going to be her wedding toast it went kinda like this"" as long as you give her, her fricken chicken you @CAPS1 will last forever"" it was not the nicest of comments to be said about that day but it was still funny to the rest of us. this is something that will last in the family for years to come ,and hopefully will be passed down in the generations to come.Even if she doesn't want it to be just think in time ens-ted of us telling every one about the incident she will tell them her self and just laugh about it because it was just that much of an out off nowhere thing to happen. We still pick on her about it and many other things she says out loud with out noticing she says them. But those are story's for another time and day you never know what could happen. just remember to laugh its true what they say its healthy for you so make the best of some of the worst days possible.  So if your having a not so good of a day,u never know what could happen to give u a smile and a laugh even if your the one that makes every one laugh. So just think of something that makes u laugh and tell the people that are special in your life about it to give them a laugh and make there day a little better then most.Even if its one of the most embarrassing events to happen to you in your life time. When we all were little and crying that was always the cure for some of the worst things even though u grow up it docent mean u cant laugh or that it means different things then it used to, when your down u need to laugh to feel better about your self don't let people put you down."	30
20797	" Someone once said,""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS1, to me that means, that since everyone laughs, laughter is the quickest or easiest way to connect with another person. I believe this because at one point in time my older brother and I did not get along very well. We were almost never around each other, and when we were,we would either be fighting or ignoring one another. It wasn't much of a problem since he is five years older; but once I became older my brother and I began to see one another more often. So we then decided to sit down one day and talk. We weren't exactly sure what to say; so for the first ten minutes we just sat there in silence. Just two guys on the back porch in the middle of the @TIME1. Then out of no were he fell over backwards into a bush. We both laughed harder than we have ever laughed in our lives. So @CAPS1, when my family get together, there isn't a lot of arguing or fighting and we all sit and tell stories and laugh.For my family and friends, laughter is one of the most important components of a relationship because, with laughter comes happiness, and with happiness comes love; and love is the most important component of life. So I say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between all people."""	33
20852	" Laughter is a very important part of life, for many different reasons. Some @MONTH1 say that its vital to survive, one needs laughter to have a full and rich life. Sometimes laughter can hurt more than it helps. This is a statement I myself believe, and have concluded from the actions and outcomes in my life. Laughter can show emotions towards a statement, or lack of emotions. Laughter can make someone either depressed or happy. It is true when someone says there is a difference when someone is laughing at you, as opposed to someone laughing with you. When a friend or a group of friends laugh with me, its an amazing, self esteem raising emotion. This laughter brings friends closer, and causes us to trust each other more. One time I thought laughing was appropriate at the time but then later felt awful. One scorching @DATE1 day my friends and I decided to venture to the mall, being we lived in apartments and lacked the money for an air conditioner. We all agreed it was a splendid idea. When we reached the mall we were relieved by the cool breeze as the doors swung open, as if to greet us. All of us are very introverted so shopping around in an over crowded mall wasn't our cup of tea. Not knowing what to @CAPS1 we sat on a bench and did what we call people watching. Their was this girl, I will always remember her; @CAPS4 was one of those girls you peer at just for a minute and you know @CAPS4 was rich. A sort of stuck up girl, a walk where @CAPS4 means to exaggerate her hips and bounce her perfect bleach blond hair.  The girl passed by us and stuck her nose in the air as if we were not even remotely good enough to be in her presence. Quite a bit angry I stood up after @CAPS4 strolled past and mocked her strut. My friends found this hysterical. Roars of laughter leaped from their mouths. The pressy girl stopped proceeding forward and then started approaching us. @CAPS4 grimaces at us all snobby-like and says, ""@CAPS1 you guys like have a problem or something?"" @CAPS2 covered my face, I didn't know what to say. Fortunately my best friend stepped in and said, ""@CAPS3, we think your dress is very pretty."" @CAPS4 believed us, then walked off, in a rather less snobby sort of way.  Through this weird and interesting experience my friends and I learned a lot. One, people can hear you talking crap about them from a mile away. Two, laughter can bring friends together, but can also have some consequences. I @CAPS1 not know for sure if @CAPS4 did hear or see us mocking her. But I knew inside I felt a little bad. Sure laughing at her in the time felt right, amusing. Looking back on it, I feel awful. I have been in that same situation but on the receiving end. It is not pleasant having people talking crap about you behind your back and laughing uncontrollably. Laughing is very vital to life but needs to be appropriate."	40
21033	                            Whats Laughter!How many friends do you really have? What relationships do you have with others? Well, I'm in high school and I usually don't have that many friends. But I have a few and one of my friends @CAPS4 friends with someone that I truly love. (@CAPS1 didn't know that) @CAPS2 year I was a freshmen and i went to the church with some of my friends and their was an @NUM1 grader that fell in the pond/water and I wasn't sure @CAPS20 @CAPS1 was @CAPS3 or not so I end up coming up to him and asked.Me; @CAPS4 you @CAPS3?, do you need some help?@CAPS1 said; @CAPS6, its @CAPS3 I just sprained my ankle.Me; @CAPS3, see you later then.Him. Later thanks for asking though.me; @CAPS9 sure, @CAPS6 problem! The next year when I'm a sophomore I didn't realized that @CAPS1 was going to be their as a freshmen! his name is @CAPS11 I was starting to hang out with him more because @CAPS1 was really funny and sweet.  We went to the @CAPS12 ball together and our other friends were their but i was worried about of some stuffs but @CAPS1 made it butter because at that time i was afraid that my ex was their. @CAPS11 was their to help me and I also didn't know how to dance and their was a song that was on and I didn't realized that i was dancing until @CAPS1 told me that I was so after was dancing with him I end up asking him @CAPS20 I can dance with one of our friends and @CAPS1 said a was able too so me and @PERSON1 ends up dancing and @CAPS1 was their when I needed him. We end up heading outside and I called @CAPS13 @CAPS14 to be picked up. So, in the mean time, we were outside waiting for her. We were laughing at some jokes that we @CAPS15 said to each other. Like one was that @CAPS1 @CAPS15 some thing in his @CAPS15 and acted like that it was a wand of some sort to the school building and @CAPS15 asked like that it was changed to a gingerbread house. Just about a week ago I end up sneaking up behind him and scared him so bad that I end up laughing and @CAPS1 was too. Because @CAPS1 usually doesn't get freaked out like that, and @CAPS1 told me that @CAPS1 is going to get me back and I'm starting to freak out from me not knowing what it @MONTH1 be. @CAPS11 is a great help when i need him!  The thing about laughter in life is that you would need eat ether way your upset or not in the mood.The main thing that was funny from my family is that we prank each other; like my sister would step out of the room and her soda is in the room that I'm in she still @CAPS15 about half of soda in the can their was mustard on the table and she hates mustard form the taste of it but my dad was thinking the same thing that I was wanting to do and that was to put a little bit of mustard in her soda. When she came back to the room I was smiling and my dad was looking at me also my @CAPS17. My sister ends up having some of the soda and she was looking at my @CAPS14 and was like;@CAPS16, who put mustard in my soda? My @CAPS17, @CAPS18, @CAPS14 and myself was laughing and she hates mustard!, @CAPS20 it was something that I didn't like and that was put in my soda I would've done this too. So, mostly I'm trying to say is that their is some laughter that is funny. not all laughter is not funny. Its butter @CAPS20 you don't prank people that is close to your heart because they @MONTH1 get mad at you. Like my sister, @PERSON2 was mad at me when it wasn't me it was my dad's idea.	27
21323	 Most people believe that laughter is an essential need for your heath, not only physically, but socially as well. In a socially tense environment it is hard to achieve what is expected of you, but if someone will introduce laughter into the environment, it quickly changes into one that becomes more simplistic, and you are able to get done what is expected of you. With this mindset I proceeded into the conference room for the first time since @PERSON1 had left. @PERSON1 was the adviser for the @ORGANIZATION1, or what we call @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON1 was the reason that a student from each school in @LOCATION1 had any say in what the @ORGANIZATION1 did or received school wise. She helped us voice our opinions and that made her a hero in the eyes of many high school students! Soon, @PERSON1's time as adviser had expired and she announced her departure from her position. After a few weeks had gone by she had found a new adviser to take her place, @PERSON2. I'm a person who is excepting of change, but the other members are not. This particular change was much to hefty for them; they just wanted things to go back to normal. When I sat down in my usual chair, the room seemed much less homely and I soon felt a sick feeling building up inside. I did not know who this woman was or what she was going to do; all I knew was that she was not @PERSON1, and she did not make the @ORGANIZATION2 members very happy.  @PERSON2 glided into the room with a welcoming spirit about her. She stood at the head of the room and smiled. The rest of the members sunk a little further into their chairs, as if they were protesting her arrival. I thought to myself, she doesn't stand a chance, as I sat a little taller and began to listen to what she had to say. She spoke in a cheerful tone and seemed to giggle after every sentence. Although her posture provoked confidence, her giggle struck nervousness. There was only one way we, as a @ORGANIZATION2, were going to get done what was needed. We had to see @PERSON2 as a friend not a foe. Immediately I decided to lighten the dank feeling in the room by starting a name game. This is a fun activity to learn a little more about people and to help @PERSON2 to remember our names. @PERSON2 seemed much more relaxed after the game so we continued with the meeting. With every second getting more serious I proposed that the meeting be done for the week and we spend the rest of the time talking and laughing about what had gone on that week. This made everyone smile. Time went on and with every passing moment the stress in the room became lighter and lighter, until the whole room was filled with laughter. It was as if @PERSON1 had never left! Soon the gathering came to a close and we all went home. On my way out @PERSON2 stopped me and told of her nervousness before the meeting because she wasn't sure how well everything was going to go. She was thankful that I jumped right in and helped brighten the spirits of the members. This eventually lead to the acceptance of the change and the effectiveness of @ORGANIZATION2. By the next meeting the members were all anxious to go back and learn a little more about @PERSON2, and were able to more fully concentrate on the matters at hand. Laughter helped the members of the @ORGANIZATION2 accept what they could not control and ultimately lead to our success today. Laughter is primarily the key to all success in the social society we live in today; with laughter anything is possible! Although the laughter was only for that one meeting, it allowed the members to be more welcoming to the idea of @PERSON2, and made for a life long friendship between our adviser, and the members of our @ORGANIZATION2. My relationship with @PERSON2 would not be as strong as it is today, if I did not share the opportunity to laugh at @PERSON2's first @ORGANIZATION2 meeting.	43
21161	" It was a day like any other. I was going to chess club to challenge the board one holder. I had never piercingly met him for I was new to the club, but I knew that if I didn't play @CAPS7 best I would lose. I entered the room hoping to see that the holder was not there, @CAPS2 was. @CAPS2 had on a blue baseball cap, a blue t-shirt, a pair of blue jeans, and a pair of black shoes. His hair was as dark as his shoes and looked as if @CAPS2 had not brushed it in years, his skin was very pale I wondered how @CAPS2 could go out in sun with out some way to block it. The board was set up and ready, @CAPS1 was the clock. the clock had an hour on each side. I walked up to him, @CAPS2 didn't even seem to notice me until I spoke, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS12 guna beat me fast. I know I'm guna lose."" @CAPS2 just sat there, staring at me like I had insulted him. ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS2 scoffed, ""your the kid they think can beat me."" ""I guess. I never really thought about it."" I was unsure as to why that would mater, but I was playing him, @CAPS1 I was absolutely sure that it was or was going to mater very soon. ""@CAPS4 please take @CAPS12 seat @CAPS1 we can begin the matches!"" the coach called out, ""@CAPS5, we all know the rules, the black player @MONTH1 start the white @CAPS4 clocks. No talking."" ""@CAPS1."" I said, ""your name is what."" ""@CAPS7 name is @CAPS8."" I hit the clock. Expecting him to be like lightning and move, I moved @CAPS7 piece. Bad move. @CAPS2 called and pointed out that I had moved a piece when it was not @CAPS7 turn. The coach came up to the clock and pressed some buttons, @CAPS2 didn't even look like @CAPS2 cared about the game and if a board ten holder could beat a board one holder. When @CAPS2 set the clock down the clock showed fifty to fifty five. I was already down on time and the game hadn't even really began.  @CAPS8 picked up the kings bishops pawn and moved it up one square. @CAPS2 hit the clock like lightning. That was wired @CAPS2 moved the weakest piece on the board. I had to stop and think for a vary long time or what felt like it. I looked over at the clock to see how I was doing on time. It was terrible I had been sitting there for about ten minutes and I hadn't even moved one lousy piece. @CAPS1 I picked up @CAPS7 king's pawn and moved up two squares hopping @CAPS2 wouldn't do anything that could hurt @CAPS7 in @CAPS13 game. I hit @CAPS7 clock.  We sat there for what must have been half an hour. @CAPS1 I got up and went to the bathroom. When I came back I checked on how the other @CAPS4 were doing. Only one game was done it was @PERSON1 and a kid I didn't know. I asked who won, it was the kid I didn't know as odd as that was I had to get back to @CAPS7 game.   @CAPS2 still hadn't moved, for a minute I thought @CAPS2 was having a problem breathing. @CAPS2 let out a yawn and moved his king's knight's pawn up two squares and hit the clock. That was weird, @CAPS2 just did fools @CAPS10. I didn't think for a minute, I piked up @CAPS7 queen and brought it all the way to one square in front of his rook pawn. I said ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10."" in a loud voice.  @CAPS2 started to laugh, at first I was confused for I beat him.Then @CAPS2 said,""I do @CAPS13 with every one I play for the first time, @CAPS13 opening.""@CAPS2 started to laugh again, @CAPS13 time I joined him we both were laughing because I beat him. Then @CAPS2 said, ""@CAPS12 are the first one to see that they could win in the first two."" That surprised me I thought that @CAPS2 won all the time when really @CAPS2 had been giving people games and the didn't know it. We started to laugh again, the coach came over and saw that I won @CAPS2 said good job and walked away. @CAPS8 said, ""@CAPS13 is the start of a new beginning I can quit board one now for there is someone who can beat me."" @CAPS2 walked up to the coach and must have told him that @CAPS2 wanted me on board one for now I'm on board one and @CAPS7 new friend, @CAPS8 is there with me on board two.

20807	"   On @DATE1, I had a mission trip meeting in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 at @NUM1 o'clock in the @TIME1. @CAPS11 friend @PERSON2 decided he would go with me. So I had @CAPS11 grandpa pick us up from the house and take us to @LOCATION2. When we got to the church I went to @CAPS11 meeting till @NUM2 o'clock, then went to bible study. I was tired and ready to go home by then.    Come to realize @CAPS11 grandpa is know where to be found, he apperently left to go home and @CAPS11 mom, grandma and @CAPS11 sister @CAPS3 had just got there to pick us up. I had just been informed that there was a parent meeting for the students going on the mission trip. After the meeting we went to @PERSON1 craft store. When we got there me and @PERSON2 went over to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, while @CAPS11 mom, grandma, and @CAPS3 stayed in @LOCATION3. I bought me and @CAPS11 mom a pair of comfortable slippers. then we went back into @PERSON1 to brag about the slippers to @CAPS11 mom and grandma.   That was a bad idea, @CAPS11 grandma decided she needed a pair for herself, so she walked over to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She was taking forever. I told her that if she stopped looking at stuff we would go to @CAPS6, get a sandwhich, and come back. So we did. When we got to @CAPS6 @PERSON2 was in a bad mood because he was ready to go home.   We ordered our sandwhichs and went back to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She finally found herself a pair of slippers, after looking for an hour and a half. Everyone gets in the car, and we think were going home when all of a sudden grandma shouts out ""were going to @LOCATION5's, I want a bowl of chili"". Our reaction was ""@CAPS10, @CAPS11 gosh"". We couldn't let her be hungry, so we had to stop. after getting her chili she says ""I need to go into @ORGANIZATION1"", @CAPS10 boy was that a mistake. We were in @ORGANIZATION1 forever in a day.   After we got back in the car from @ORGANIZATION1 I sat in the backseat in the middle of @CAPS3 and @ORGANIZATION2. I told @PERSON2 not to forget to show @CAPS11 mom an important piece of mail he had when we got home, and his response was ""@CAPS10 ya! If we ever get home"". All I could do was laugh. I was being video taped by @PERSON2 and @CAPS11 mom kept looking back at me to see if I was ok. I just couldn't stop laughing. I laughed so hard I was crying, I lost all @CAPS11 breath, and @CAPS11 face was as red as a cherry. I laughed without a break from @ORGANIZATION1 to @LOCATION4 road. When I eventually fell asleep."	35
21206	"One day I woke @CAPS6 staring out my window and was listening to the birds chirp out my window I usually leave my window open to sleep with fresh air because I hate breathing in my own breath its to warm anyways as I woke @CAPS6 I walked out and ate some rice crispy s with my to sisters @PERSON2 and @PERSON3. As I was about to finish I had realized I was late for school I was only I @NUM1 grade so I ran got dressed and told my sisters to @CAPS5 and get ready but you no how girls can be putting @CAPS4 there make-@CAPS6 and doing there hair.      My sister @PERSON2 was in @NUM2 grade and my other sister was in @NUM3 grade our schools were right next to each other so they finally got ready and we were @CAPS4 our way heading off to school ready for an awesome day with my teacher @PERSON4hawk. She wasn't the nicest teacher in the world but I only liked her was because when we were cleaning our desk she gave us shaving cream and me and my friend @PERSON1 would have so much fun playing in the cream. We began the day with a book and the book was by ""@CAPS1 foul"" I can't recall the name but I remember the cover was gold an was about ghouls and monsters the way she read it was like if we were there that book was so intense even tho i really didn't understand it. Next she would give us a math worksheet I know right math in @NUM1 grade but I was really smart at math and she would always pick @CAPS4 me and give me harder math then others and when I asked her why I was getting harder math then the other kids she had told me I was different. I new I was smarter then some kids but not all so I never knew if that was a complement or an insult but I really didn't care. So now that we got that out of the way we can get to the fun part were all the laughter is so school is over right and I'm trying to find my sister to walk me home, after @NUM5 min looking for i find her walking to the cross walk I yell her name ""@CAPS2"". She looks and I'm running to her and her friends as you no she didn't want to be seen with an annoying little brother so she ran across the street.   My dad was waiting in the car and my sister got to the car before me and I was in a @CAPS5 to get to the car and I had to wait for the cross guard lady to @CAPS3 to me. At last she finally had noticed me, I was @CAPS4 walking in an hurried past to get to the car because I had herd my dad yelling ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6""so I was walking faster and faster and as I was walking I herd from a distance a car speeding down the street, but what I hadn't noticed it was it was heading straight for me. The car came flying around the corner nearly hit the cross guard lady, the car had hit the crossing stick the out of no were I was hit flying and rolling down the street. I was hit and bruised cuts every were my dad was panicking ran out of the car screaming at the lady who had hit me and getting her information license plate number.    As I was laying @CAPS4 the ground my dad came to me and was trying to get me @CAPS6 he pulled down my pants to see the damage and remember I had my scooby-doo underwear @CAPS4 and every one was staring at me I was more embarrassed then hurt I didn't feel the pain until the next day so I was all good I couldn't walk so my dad ran put me in the car and every one was laughing at me because they saw my underwear @CAPS4 and my dad rushed me to the house and then called the ambulance. they told my dad that I would be able to walk again but would have trouble doing sports because i have a fractured hip. i was living the dream my sisters were spoiling me giving me candy and my dad giving me ice cream and @CAPS4 top of that I couldn't feel the pain. Bu t the fireman said I should be able to go to school the next day and I did and my mean old teacher saw me and i was limping and what she told me got me mad she had told me to ""stop faking it"". I had told my mom that and she got so mad man you would not want to be that teacher so lets say it wasn't pretty. You're probably wondering what happened to the lady who hit me she pays for my docter bills. "	34
20795	 Its always hard to know what to do when a friend or family member comes to you when they are sad or mad. Most of the time you don't know what to do. I have learned that making people laugh with something as simple as a joke can always make them feel better. As I was sitting at home one sunny afternoon, I got a call from my friends @PERSON1. When I put the phone to my ear all I could hear was a loud crying. @PERSON1 wasn't saying anything to me, not one word. Even though, I repeatedly asked her what was wrong with her, @PERSON1 wouldn't even say a word. Not knowing what to do or say to her anymore, I asked her to calm down and take deep breaths. Desperately, I wanted her to be able to talk to me and tell me what was going on because I had started to get really worry. Couple minutes later, @PERSON1 started explaining to me what had happen. @PERSON1 started off by telling me she was irresponsible that she didn't pay attention to what was happening around her. I asked her why she was saying that about herself because I knew she was a responsible person. Finally, @PERSON1 screamed that while she was home watching the @CAPS1 basketball team play basketball, her dog @CAPS2 got run over. The dog had actually died. I found it very ridiculous and pathetic that @PERSON1 would be crying over her dog. I didn't want to be rude about it and tell her what was going threw my mind at that time. Even thought that was the way I felt about the whole situation. I thought of what the words I needed to say to @PERSON1 but I was confuse. Actually, it wasn't so much that I was confuse, I was afraid of hurting her feelings with my words. Finally, I decided to tell her not to worry about her dog, that my friend had a couple of dogs for sale. Also, I told @PERSON1 that if it made her feel any better I would buy her a new puppy. After saying that to her there was an awkward silence. My hands started to get shaky because I thought @PERSON1 was mad. All of the sudden I just heard her start laughing really loud and once again she couldn't talk. I felt so relief that I had made her laugh and not cry or get mad at me. @PERSON1 wouldn't shut her mouth she just laughed and laughed and laugh hysterically. Finally, she shut her mouth up and started talking to me again. @PERSON1 thanked me for making her laugh and making a joke out the situation. Rather than saying depressing words that would make her feel bad and make her cry even more. I was happy I made her laugh because she felt better about herself and not worst. As I was laughing I told her that anytime she needed to laugh I was the person she needed to be call. Anytime, any day and anywhere I would be happy to bring a smile to her face and a loud laugh to her mouth. @PERSON1 laughed with me and thank me one more time for making her laugh. From that day on I always like to make people laugh because I know I'm going to make them feel better. I sure love it when others make me laugh too. It's just an amazing feeling, a great feeling that everyone loves and cant really describe. After making my friend @PERSON1 laugh I found out laughter was a key element of life.   	35
21506	"  I love laughing! Laughing makes me feel satisfied and happy. When I laugh with someone I don't know, I feel like I've known them for a long time. When I laugh with someone I do know, I feel fully content. But there is one person with whom I love to laugh with most of all, my cousin @PERSON1. I think that laughing is an important part of our relationship because when we laugh, its magical. Magical as in how fast and @CAPS5 it takes to make one of us laugh. We will say almost anything, the most random but humorous things, then we will laugh until we literally cry.   One @TIME1, when we were talking on the phone, we decided to call up our other cousin anonymously. When he didn't pick up we hung up disappointed. I was thinking of the @CAPS1 movie that I had just watched a few hours ago and an idea slowly started coming to me. I started talking in @CAPS1 to my cousin, pretending that I was our aunt from @LOCATION2. I told her how I was coming over for a visit in the @DATE1 @CAPS11 they had better be prepared. I like my bed nice and soft, fluffy pillows, and my own bathroom. I was the picky aunt. I want everything perfect for when I come. We laughed and laughed. Then @PERSON1 says to me, ""@CAPS3 don't we call @CAPS4 again and if he doesn't pick up, we'll leave a message."" ""@CAPS5 will we say in the message?"", I asked. ""@CAPS6'll just say that @CAPS6're his aunt from @LOCATION2 and that @CAPS6're coming for a visit and all the rest @CAPS6'll just make up.""""@CAPS7"", I said hesitantly. I dialed star six seven then his number and pressed talk.  Luckily, no one picked up. But when the answering machine beeped allowing me to record a message, I was speechless. Then I started in my high picky aunt voice, ""@CAPS8 @CAPS4, this is your aunt @LOCATION1 and I..."" I burst out laughing before I could continue. ""I.. I'm coming over for a visit in.."", again I exploded. I could hear @PERSON1 laughing in the background, which made me laugh even harder. I tried again this time getting farther into the story laughing here and there. By the time I had reached the maximum amount of time for the message, I was @CAPS11 into it that I didn't want to stop. When the message ended, I was only half way done. @CAPS11 after the answering machine was done talking, I pressed two to here my message. As I listened, I couldn't help thinking about @CAPS5 a complete fool I sounded like. @PERSON1 kept shushing me each time I laughed to loud, but I could tell she wanted to laugh too. She was just holding it in. When I hung up, I called her back and when she answered I said, ""@CAPS10 do it again because I didn't finish.""@CAPS11 we called again and this time I said the rest more willingly and I barely laughed. I was saving it for when we listened to it.   When we had our fill of laughter and wiping tears, @PERSON1 said, ""That was the most hilarious thing we ever did together, we have to do it again sometime."" ""For sure"", I told her. But it was late into the @TIME1, and time to go. When we had finished our good bye's and I love @CAPS6's we hung up. That @TIME1 and every other time I laugh, I think @CAPS5 would it be like if no one could laugh. @CAPS5 a boring place this would be, @CAPS5 a lifeless life. When I laugh, I feel lively. I want to live to laugh another day. If there were no laughter, that would be a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.   "	45
21209	"Fishing trip gone wrong @CAPS1 me introduce you to what I will be talking about today, fishing. Fishing has been a big part of @CAPS7 life ever since I was born. When I was little I used to go out with @CAPS7 dad and brother to go fishing. @CAPS7 dad loved to take us to go lake fishing. Ive fished every lake around these parts. When I was five years old I got a brand new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole it was so shiny and had a great ball bearing spinning reel. It even had some chrome going up the handle so when the sun hit it just right it would shoot a beams of bright light @CAPS18 the ground. Well as I grew older so did @CAPS7 fishing pole. The reel didn't turn as well and the chrome didn't shine like it used to.  When I turned @MONEY1 @CAPS7 pole was a broken down and just wouldn't work for @CAPS7 fishing needs anymore. So @CAPS18 the day of @CAPS7 tenth birthday @CAPS7 family and friends gave me a some money. I told them that I wanted to buy a new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole. So after @CAPS7 birthday I had acquired one hundred and @MONEY1. I thought I was the richest man in the whole wide world. Latter that night @CAPS7 dad came up to me and told me that @CAPS7 cousins wedding was this @DATE1 and that we might have time after to @CAPS15 a little bit of fishing. I went into the garage and packed @CAPS7 tackle box with pliers, hooks, spinners and all the fishing gear I would need.  After the @CAPS7 cousins wedding @CAPS7 dad said ""@CAPS6 go fishing."" @CAPS7 dad and I changed into our fishing clothes and were off but I had remembered that I needed a fishing pole so I asked ""@CAPS8 dad we need to stop at @ORGANIZATION1 quickly"". It turned out that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS18 the way. We pulled into the @ORGANIZATION1 parking lot and I went in. I ran over to there sporting goods and found the last @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole siting @CAPS18 the shelf so I got it down and looked it over. This was the pole for me, the only downside was the price that happened to be seventy @MONEY1. I bought it anyways. I walked out of the store with @CAPS7 new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole feeling like I was a million bucks.  As we arrived at our fishing spot I noticed that we were not at a lake but a large river. @CAPS7 dad explained that I needed to be safe around the river cause you can get swept away if you fall in. I got out of our car and the wind was harsh. It was chilling to the bone. I took out @CAPS7 new pole and tackle box and started to setup @CAPS7 pole for river fishing. I put @CAPS18 one large weight and big hook. I was ready for anything or at least I thought. I then reached down into @CAPS7 big red tackle box and pulled out a large worm. ""I think the fish will love this."" I say aloud to @CAPS7 dad. Staring out at the fast flowing water and toss @CAPS7 baited fishing line off shore. A big splash of water then ripples, @CAPS7 dad and I smile with satisfaction. Right next to me was a branch buried within the embankment. Setting @CAPS7 pole down rather softly I look upon @CAPS7 dad as he pulls in a fish.  Well @CAPS18 our walk down to river there was this @CAPS13 @CAPS14 outhouse. Me needing to use the restroom, I turned to @CAPS7 right and said to @CAPS7 dad ""@CAPS15 not lose @CAPS7 fishing pole, I don't want it to going flying into the river if I get a big fish @CAPS18."" @CAPS7 dad reply's ""@CAPS17, @CAPS17 just go to the bathroom already."" @CAPS18 @CAPS7 walk to the bathroom I didn't see the big @CAPS19 that had landed near @CAPS7 fishing line. @CAPS7 dad saw them getting closer and closer to @CAPS7 line so he thought it would be a good idea to scare them away. As soon as I walk out of the bathroom @CAPS7 dad goes running and waving his arms at the @CAPS19. They all take off into the air, but something was trailing behind one of them weighing it down. What was it you @MONTH1 ask? It was @CAPS7 brand new fishing pole! It was at least @NUM1 maybe @NUM2 feet in the air. As soon as @CAPS7 pole took off flying it started falling. It didn't land @CAPS18 shore but it landed in the middle of this big wide river. @CAPS7 dad looks at me and says with a smile ""That's the first fishing pole that I've ever seen fly."" I start laughing uncontrollably then @CAPS7 dad starts cracking up. After the laughter was done @CAPS7 dad looked @CAPS18 shore for something to pull @CAPS7 pole in with but to @CAPS7 surprise he found it @CAPS18 shore down river.Will @CAPS20"	42
21246	" Laughing at @CAPS1 bell. @CAPS11 best friend and I have a lot of funny, hilarious memories together. We are always laughing about something even if @CAPS7's something completely stupid or actually really funny. We laugh at things like people that look funny, or people that say stupid things. Also we laugh at funny things we do. @CAPS8 one thing that has always stuck to @CAPS11 head, the time at @CAPS1 bell. One day after school, me and @CAPS11 best friend @PERSON1 decided to go across the street from our school and eat lunch at @CAPS1 bell. We ordered our food and went to sit down and wait for @CAPS7. A few minuets later our food was ready and we sat down to eat @CAPS7. ""@CAPS4"" I said to @LOCATION1 as i took a bite of @CAPS11 @CAPS5 five layer burrito. ""@CAPS6""@CAPS7 was really hot and burned @CAPS11 mouth. I had to wait for a few minuets to eat @CAPS11 burrito. So we both just sat, waiting for our burritos to cool off, an talked about school and other things that was going on with our lives. A couple minuets later a man walked in, he was about @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old, and he had his back against us so we couldn't see his face. The man ordered his food and turned around to take a seat. Meanwhile I thought @CAPS11 burrito was cooled down enough and i went to take a bite, at the same time the man looked at us and he was wearing a clown mask and he had a little dog with a tiara on his head. Next thing i knew @CAPS11 burrito was coming out of @CAPS11 mouth and I was dieing of laughter.  @CAPS11 burrito was spit completely out of @CAPS11 mouth, and all over me an @LOCATION1. All over @CAPS11 hair, mouth, clothes, and all over the table. I was so embarrassed that i couldn't help @CAPS8 to laugh. I think the main reason i was laughing so hard was because the man was just so scary looking, @CAPS8 wow we were laughing for what seemed like an hour straight. You might think this was the end of @CAPS11 bad day, @CAPS8 @CAPS7 only gets worse. Eating @CAPS11 burrito seemed forever, because we were laughing forever. @CAPS7 probable took me a good ten minutes to eat a single burrito. Meanwhile i got thirsty and needed something to drink. So I went to order a small drink and get some @CAPS10. As i was returning to @CAPS11 table i wasn't looking and ran into a man that was in line. I almost spilled @CAPS11 @CAPS10 @CAPS8 luckily I didn't. Returning to @CAPS11 seat i was talking to @PERSON1 about how bad @CAPS11 day was, and how @CAPS7 couldn't get any worse. Then i took a drink an I started to choke on @CAPS11 @CAPS10, @CAPS7 was so bad that i spit everything out onto @LOCATION1, @CAPS10 went flying everywhere, @CAPS7 even came out of @CAPS11 noes. So i went into the bathroom, and cleaned @CAPS11 self up, caught @CAPS11 breath, and told @PERSON1 i was ready to go home. When i look back and think about the day at @CAPS1 bell with @CAPS11 best friend, I not only think about how embarrassing @CAPS7 was for me and her, @CAPS8 also that @CAPS7 was a really great, hilarious memory that i will probably remember for the rest of @CAPS11 life. As i said before @CAPS11 best friend and I have a lot of funny memories together, and still we are making more everyday."	37
21245	" What exactly is laughter? Is it when something virtuous happens and it makes a person joyful? According to @PERSON1's @CAPS1, laughter is a cause of merriment. In other words a light heart-ed fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships, but plays a big role in life itself. An example of laughter being important in relationships is, when a very good friend of mine stopped speaking to me over this empty-headed quarrel we had about some animal becoming instinct. It had been almost two years exactly, since her and I haven't spoken. I thought nothing would brings us together, until one day when I was at the store and we ran into each other. We just looked at one another and just started laughing. Right than and there we figured out that the argument we had was pointless, and not worth talking about. To be more clear with this story is that without laughter my friend and I would have never been reunited. When you meet new people what's the first thing you tend to do to get them to enjoy you? You usually tell jokes, or say something funny just to get a chuckle or two out of them. This is where laughter ties into life, physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual. When you meet a new person you often see those individuals have at least one thing in common. I guarantee that in every single friendship laughter is the most common thing people share together. There is no possible way of getting around it. Another example of why laughter is important in life is when someone is looking for a job, or going to a job interview and the one who is in charge of making the decision of whether or not you get the job has no personality. What do you most often do in this type of situation, either show your serious side or possibly crack a few jokes. If this doesn't work well at least that person has a good idea about your personality. Learning how to handle life can become very stressful, also trying to handle it mentally can be quite a challenge. A friend of mine just graduated from college and she was struggling on trying to find a job that she studied in. She was very stressed out, and also very depressed because her grandma was in the hospital and ready to pass on. @CAPS3 didn't know what to do, no money was coming in yet, and she couldn't find an apartment she just was a mess. Until one day she told me that she revived a call from her sister and her sister mentioned that their grandma couldn't hold on and she was ready to pass. @CAPS3 rushed to the hospital and went to go see the last of her grandma before she passed. Her grandma grabbed her hand and told her, ""I know life can be mean and just give you no chances but you have to get through that and enjoy life. Life's to short to be worrying about what tomorrow will bring. Just put that smile on your face and laugh when life gives you the worst."" @CAPS2 and there @CAPS3 realized that what her grandma had said was true. You can't live through life in a drag, just have to get up and take it. @CAPS3 was very devastated about her grandmas lost, but @CAPS2 again she felt it was meant to happen because without her grandma telling her about this she wouldn't have never known that her grandma experienced the same thing as she did. She didn't feel like she was the only one in the world that was going through these difficult crisis. She will always love her grandma.  When you learn how to take life as it comes people tend to notice it is indeed a very hard step to achieve. Individuals learn in many other ways or some just don't learn at all. For example, @CAPS3 learned from experience going on with school and struggling with tying to find a job. Her grandma told her right before she passed on because her grandma probably most likely experienced it as well. Other people learn form meeting new people, and just having fun with life, or like me I learned the hard way by not talking to a very good friend of mine over a empty- headed argument. Laughter comes in different shapes and sizes, we as human beings have to approach it, whether it's an argument or learning it as it comes. One way or another it will come and we have to be ready for it, its not a scary thing. The benefits of laughter is it makes you happy and people tend to be having a good time. Laughter is a positive thing, and people shouldn't ignore it, its a good stress reliever as well. Laughter is a cause of merriment, a light heart-ed fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships but plays a big role in life itself."	40
20955	 Everyone laughs differently , some people laugh so hard that they cry, and some don't. But one thing that they have in common is laughter. People use laughter as a way to express their feelings of joy, or happiness, or even if something is just really funny to them. Laughing is a great way to feel happier about something for instance maybe you are having a bad day and then one of your friends comes up to you and tells you a funny joke. It makes you feel better, right? Having a good sense of humor is something that can help you get through tough situations, embarrassing things, or even like I said just a bad day. Being able to laugh at yourself and even something that you might have done that was embarrassing is a good thing, it can help you get over it and not be so embarrassed about it. Whenever I laugh I always feel better, laughing reminds me of all the good things in life. Laughing reminds me of good times I have spent with friends and family, it reminds me of all the inside jokes my friends and I have come up with over the years and that we can still laugh at just as hard as we used to. I believe that laughing is enjoyable for everyone it can make you feel better no matter what and some people even say that laughing makes you younger. When you laugh at things it creates long lasting memories that you will never forget and when you talk about them again in the future you will still think it is just as funny as before. Some of my best friends laugh at everything, they think that every little joke is the funniest ever, their laughs are unforgettable you can always hear them laughing. Which in another way shows how laughter can make anyone happy. If you believe that you are not a funny person, just say something to one of them and I can guarantee that they will laugh at it and you will feel funny and most likely start laughing as well.  I enjoy getting to spend quality time with some of my closest friends, and probably the best time I had with them was when we went to @ORGANIZATION1 for the beginning of @DATE1 before going into high school. It was two days after our promotion (graduation) from middle school. We packed up my family's car and headed out for @ORGANIZATION1. Not even half-an-hour into the car ride and we are already cracking up laughing at every little thing going on. We always create great memories and this one was already in the books for one of the best. I am sure that the car ride for my mom and aunt was just as fun, we sang songs and danced (as much as we could buckled down in a seat) to as many songs as we could fit in those two hours. Of course during the car ride we got stopped by construction so we decided to jump out of the car and do a @CAPS1 fire drill around it. All the others cars watched and laughed at us even the construction workers though it was funny. We made a boring moment fun. Once we finally got there we did not hesitate to drop off our bags and grab our bikes and take off and explore. The weather was so nice, not a cloud in the sky. During our exploration bike ride we laughed, told jokes, and just talked about how excited we were to be out of middle school and moving on to high school. The next day we decided that we wanted to float down the river on a raft, sounds like a fun idea. Well it would be if we actually knew where we were going, I used to do it all the time with my family so I had an idea of where to go, but still five girls two rafts and a river, maybe not such a good idea. During the whole river raft trip we jumped back and forth between the two rafts occasionally splashing each other with the oars. Knowing us we laughed the whole way down the river. Whenever we passed people I'm sure they thought something was wrong with us by how much we were laughing and enjoying each others company. By the time we finished the rafting trip we were hungry good thing my mom had prepared us some lunch for when we got home, when we sat down at the table we could never keep a straight face. What made it even funnier was that my aunt and my mom didn't know what we were laughing at because we could just look at each other and laugh. You know you have built a good friendship when you can just look at each other and laugh, already knowing what your friend is thinking because of all the inside jokes you have with each other. All because of one little thing called laughter.                                     	40
21613	 Before my best friend moved away, we would stay up at night just laughing for no reason at all. I don't know what would get us started, but it would not stop until our stomachs hurt so bad from laughing that we just fell asleep. On these nights, her mom would come in around @TIME1 and ask us nicely to please quiet down, which just made us laugh more. When we are together, it is quite dangerous to be around. We have gotten so close that we are practically sisters in a way. Laughter is important in all of my relationships. I grew up in a large family where laughter is key, and positive attitudes were expected.  Over the @DATE1, @CAPS1 and I work together, so we have lots of time to get our thinking on the same track. If we are on a short car ride and we want to go somewhere, we make it happen. We are very good at manipulating our elders, a skill acquired from years of practicing on @CAPS2. All it takes is one look to see what the other is plotting, then a laugh will follow, letting the manipulated know that it is doomed, or very soon to be. Our schemes are generally harmless, possibly just a little side ache from being tickled too hard. It does not help that we are both small, strong, and packed full of energy, just waiting for the right person to come along. @CAPS1 and I find ways to stir up mischief all around us, whether it be jumping out from behind corners or taking the manager's keys.  When I go somewhere, I am generally aiming for positive places with an upbeat atmosphere and people that make me happy. I dislike and avoid places I don't enjoy, I am one to make jokes or be sarcastic when things are too quiet or too serious. Serious environments intimidate me, @CAPS6 are out of my comfort zone. Laughter brings people together, and it lightens people's moods. Nobody likes the awkward situations where no one is saying anything, so I generally will break the silence with a blond joke or something.  I was flying home to @ORGANIZATION2 from @LOCATION3, @CAPS3 and met a couple great people on the way. When I boarded the plane I looked around for a place to sit then decided on the seat between an elderly woman and a man who resembled my father (I was alone on the flight). I thought, for the next hour I will be with these people, so I had better make it something to remember. The man had helped me get my carry-on into the overhead storage, which was very nice of him. The elderly woman and I started talking, and the subject of horses came up, and when horses come up in conversion, @CAPS6 are usually paired with lots of falling stories. She talked about this @CAPS4 horse called @CAPS4 @CAPS5, how he had a mind of his own, and how he would do things his way. The problem with horses is this: @CAPS6 know that @CAPS6 are a slight deal bigger than us, and can really do as @CAPS6 please, but most choose to listen as @CAPS6 don't like to be corrected. I told about my first few rides, and how I didn't know much besides how to steer the massive animal beneath me. Before we knew it, we were landing in @LOCATION1, and my new friends got off the plane.  When my plane landed in @LOCATION1, I figured I would be flying to @ORGANIZATION2 sitting alone. After a few minutes, a teenage girl got on and sat next to me. The first thing she did was offer me a piece of gum, which I accepted. The first bit of the ride was quiet, but after awhile the crying baby got annoying to listen to so we started talking. She was flying to @LOCATION2 to her dad's house. We talked about our families and hobbies, and had a good time. After we flew into @ORGANIZATION1, I welcomed myself back home, I was back in the eternal rain state, and couldn't see anything besides clouds out of my window. Laughter is all around us, and there are always things to laugh about, look on the bright side of life. People are more attracted to those who can make them laugh, so get a sense of humor and you will be in good company. Giggles and smiles make the world go around, so keep laughing. 	40
20842	" I kept my head low as I walked through the halls of the brand new school I'd been signed up to attend. Students passed me with warm smiles, but I didn't dare meet their gazes, I couldn't. This is what real school is like, I thought to myself. I'd always been home schooled, since before I could remember, and now my parents felt that I should be introduced to a public school, in my last year of middle school @CAPS12 less. My dark, curly brown hair fell into my face as I entered my first class, acting. The room was warm and dimly lit as students began to recite their lines; the sets were colorful and I instantly recognized them as the garden from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. I suddenly let out a small yelp as my foot caught in the doorstop, sending me tumbling into a chair.  Deep red color flooded to my cheeks as I looked up and realized that every student in the room was staring at me. I let out a troubled sigh and brushed my hair over my face, wishing I was back home, in my favorite chair studying for my mother's vocabulary tests. I glanced up through my hair and a quick smile flashed across my face as I realized I was @CAPS12 longer the center of attention.  ""@CAPS1, you must be @CAPS2, the new student."" @PERSON1 said warmly.  I smiled and nodded my head slowly, ""@CAPS3, that would be me.""  @CAPS4 smiled at me just as I'd smiled at @CAPS13, but @CAPS13 smile seemed sad, ""I'm sorry dear, but all the parts for this play have been taken, but you are more than welcome to help paint the sets next class.""  I nodded and reached into my backpack, pulling out a book and quickly buried my nose into the pages of my favorite romance novel. I was instantly taken to another time and place, and I wished with all my heart that I could truly go there. I was suddenly jerked from my imagination when a small pixie looking girl took a seat beside me.  @CAPS4 didn't say anything for a moment, just looking at me. @CAPS13 hair was a few shades darker than mine, more black than brown but @CAPS4 wore @CAPS14 @CAPS8. @CAPS13 bright blue eyes twinkled with imagination, as did @CAPS13 face. Something about @CAPS13 seemed kind. Maybe @CAPS14 was the way @CAPS13 dimples came out even though @CAPS4 wasn't smiling, or @CAPS14 could have been the way @CAPS4 sat, tall with confidence.  ""@CAPS5, hello?"" I murmured, closing my book, careful to mark the page. ""I didn't mean to interrupt, but you looked all alone, and I thought I'd come over and say hello. My name is @CAPS6, but everyone calls me @CAPS7."" @CAPS4 said with another smile, making @CAPS13 dimples come out even more. I chuckled softly and returned @CAPS13 smile, ""@CAPS8, I'm @CAPS2, nice to meet you.""  ""@CAPS10, don't take this the wrong way, but you aren't from around here, are you?"" @CAPS4 asked hesitantly. My smile fell slightly, ""@CAPS12, I've always been home schooled, I've never actually been to a public school before.""  @CAPS13 smile fell with my own, and i could tell that @CAPS4 knew what I was talking about.  ""@CAPS14's not always a bad thing though, I'm glad that I'm finally getting to go to a public school."" I murmured, the lie coming easily.  @CAPS4 laughed and layed a soft hand on my shoulder, ""@CAPS12 need to lie,""  I knew that half of @CAPS13 words were serious, and the others playful but something deep inside of me shifted. I barely knew this girl but I felt that I could trust @CAPS13, and that we could be friends.  We laughed and joked the rest of the class, and I was almost always caught up in the way that @CAPS4 constantly got flustered while trying to explain things to me. @CAPS4'd try and use @CAPS13 hands, make movements, just to explain, which always took us into a new round of giggles because of how ridiculous we both were acting and I was startled when the bell for lunch rang, had time really passed that fast? @CAPS7 smiled at me, ""@CAPS16 for lunch @CAPS2?"" A smile broke out across my face, maybe I wasn't as alone as I'd thought. With just a few giggles and laughs, an entire friendship was planted in a ground that I'd thought was to stony to hold any life at all. By just opening myself up a little bit, and showing a side of vulnerability and even fear, I'd opened the doorway to an entire future of conversations, to smiles, tears, secrets but above all, hope. This place was @CAPS12 longer a place of torture, exclusion and sadness, but a place where I could go to see my new friend, a friend who eventually became my sister, a woman who I began to trust and understand with all my heart, and I finally came to realize that we weren't as different as I'd once thought. We were one and the same all along."	40
20766	" Laughter and exuberance are key elements in any good relationship. Being able to be giddy and joyful with someone close to @CAPS11 is a sign of comfort. It often can bring people closer and help to solidify their friendships. Your true self is shown in your humor. Two years ago when I was in @PERSON1's seventh grade math class at @ORGANIZATION1, I was chosen to be in the @ORGANIZATION2 along with just three other classmates. Being in the @ORGANIZATION2 simply meant that we would be teaching ourselves @CAPS1-@CAPS2 using only textbooks, while @PERSON1 would teach the rest of the class an easier, more simple math. The @ORGANIZATION2 was almost like an elite club. Our other classmates looked upon us with jealousy because we got to sit in the back of the classroom together, never had to do any homework, and were never called upon out of the blue to answer questions in front of the whole class. Being the immature seventh graders that we were, we abused @TIME1 incredible opportunity that we had. I became fast friends with the three other people in the @ORGANIZATION2. Their names were @PERSON4, @PERSON3, and @CAPS3. @PERSON4 and I were already friends, but it was working together in the @ORGANIZATION2 that really brought us closer together. I also became close with @ORGANIZATION3 and @CAPS3. To @TIME1 day, @PERSON4 is one of my very best friends and I still keep in touch with the other two. We were all very different from each other. @PERSON3 was caught up in the popular crowd, @CAPS3 usually hung out with the really smart kids who were into chess and reading books, and @PERSON4 and I were just normal. However, we all had two important things in common; our sick sense of humor and our intelligence.  We each felt that the work we were teaching ourselves was much too easy. We breezed right through the book and never really had any questions. In doing @CAPS8, we always finished our assigned work quickly and had more than half of the class left to just sit there, eat, and goof off. That doesn't necessarily mean that that's the order things played out in. ""@PERSON4, I don't feel like doing math @DATE2. I'm beat,"" I complained as we walked into @PERSON1's room for math right after lunch. ""@CAPS6 neither,"" she replied. ""I say we just sit there and make it look like we're doing work."" We made our way to the table in the back where @CAPS3 and @PERSON3 were already sitting. They had their books, pencils, and spirals out, but sat there with vacant expressions. @PERSON4 and I joined them in sitting and we all exchanged disgruntled looks. ""@CAPS8 uh, I was talking to @LOCATION1 @TIME1 and he said that we don't have to do any work @DATE2. We can just sit here and hang out,"" I lied, not even bothering to hide my smirk. Catching on, @CAPS3 and @PERSON3 grinned. @PERSON3 turned around and pulled a brown paper bag out of her backpack. She began to pull food out of the bag and offered it all up to us. I immediately grabbed the miniature chocolate pie. Midway through eating it, I dipped my finger in the gooey chocolate and wiped a big blob of it on the window behind @CAPS6. @PERSON4 noticed and immediately started to chuckle. ""@CAPS10, what's that?!"" she exclaimed, loud enough for everyone in the class to hear. @PERSON1 and a few classmates glanced over briefly, but got back to the lesson instantly. It really wasn't funny at all, but the four of us dissolved into giggles. ""@CAPS11 guys, I had @TIME1 crazy dream @TIME2,"" @PERSON3 said as the laughter died down. ""I went to @TIME1 @DATE1 camp thing, and @PERSON2 was one of the camp counselors. He was wearing khaki pants and a white shirt with blue pinstripes. Oh, and he also had a clipboard!"" We stared at her blankly and then burst out laughing once more. The funny thing about @TIME1, was that @PERSON2 often substituted for our teachers, and he wore that exact outfit each time. But the even funnier thing was that it really wasn't funny at all. We were @CAPS8 desperate for a good time, we found chocolate blobs on windows and khaki pants to be hilarious. Our laughter died down and we sat there in silence. Suddenly, @CAPS3 leaned back in his squeaky swivel chair and it immediately broke, dropping him right to the ground. To anyone else, @TIME1 would have been funny. However, we each sat in silence, staring at one another. It wasn't that we were embarrassed for him or felt sympathy, but simply ironic that obsolete things sent us into fits of giggles, while a substantial, laughable event made us simply sit there. I don't think I'll ever forget the @ORGANIZATION2. Though it was a waste of time, we had many good laughs. We @MONTH1 not have learned a lot about math, but we learned a lot about each other."	45
21542	" Laughter is what I'd like to call a ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @CAPS3"". Because no matter what language or tongue you speak, when something funny occurs, the natural reaction is to laugh. This reaction is present for all people, and when it takes place; it's contagious and helps to bring everyone together. Laughter also emits a sense of happiness and joy, which in return makes people feel more free and open to join in and laugh as well. In many instances, if there is an awkward situation at hand, laughter plays a big role in lightening the mood; and making the atmosphere a little more comfortable. In @DATE1 laughter was a big key in the success of our annual @ORGANIZATION1.  Our @ORGANIZATION1 consists of around @NUM1 people (including cousins, and some close friends); so as you can see it @MONTH1 not be easy to get to know and interact with everyone. However, at dinner time we like to switch it up, and sit next to relatives that you wouldn't normally sit next to. At first, it's usually very awkward, and sometimes even frightening for the younger kids, when they end up to sitting next to our very loud and opinionated aunts and uncles. That is until my @LOCATION1 decides to crack one of his hilarious jokes.  My @LOCATION1 is somewhat of a @CAPS4 of awkwardness. Not necessarily that he enjoys being in awkward situations, but rather that he enjoys watching them play out. Eventually about halfway through the meal, after eating in close to utter silence; he decides to stand up and give a little toast to the @ORGANIZATION1. Following the speech, he always concludes with a well rehearsed joke; which, gets everyone laughing. Some of the younger cousins don't always understand the play on words. But what really gets them going, is listening to all of our aunts and uncles hoot and holler things like ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"" and ""@CAPS7 help me"" mixed in with their obnoxious laughs. After all the fun dies down, the awkwardness always seems to drift away, leaving us with the feelings of happiness and joy that I described earlier. I believe that those feelings directly correlate to lightening the mood, and in helping to get everyone more comfortable with who they happen to be sitting by. Once all these things occur, conversation gets flowing and everyone ends up getting to know a @ORGANIZATION1 member, that they otherwise might have not gotten the chance to truly meet. Laughter is one of the keys to happiness in life; because without it, life would be very dull and boring. Laughter also has the power to change situations, and to make them better for the most part.  In @DATE1, laughter changed a situation in my life for the better, just like it has done so many times since then. In my eyes, laughter is the best @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 out there. If you really want to get to know a person, all you have to do is make them laugh!"	40
20819	 LaughterI laugh everyday. I feel a lot of different emotions when I am laughing. Some of the emotions are happiness, sadness, and pain. I use laughter to let my emotions be seen. when I laugh I usually feel happy after wards en less I am crying because I am hurt. When I am sad I tend to laugh and smile a lot to hide the pain I am feeling because I don't want people to see me sad all the time and think I am playing the sad card to get attention. But laughing and smiling actually make everything hurt worse instead of making it better. When I am sad i tend to rely on laughter to get me threw my day because if i didn't have laughter i would have people asking what was wrong all day and it would drive me crazy. When I am angry the only way I can laugh is if a friends or family member is trying to make me happy or if I am reminiscing of fun times iv had. It makes me happy when I laugh and brightens my day when I am anger. I also laugh at things people say to me even tho they hurt my feelings when they said it, because I don't want them to know they hurt me. When I am happy all I do is smile and laugh. Laughter brightens my life when its a happy laugh.My friends and I can just sit there and laugh for hours and nothing. My friends and I can be pretty silly at times and all we can do is laugh, have fun and be in a good mood, and that makes me pretty happy. Some things in my life that make me laugh are my nephew my family and friends. All those things I was just talking about come into my mind when I think of laughter. I think that every single person needs some laughter in there life to be happy.  	30
20814	" Laughter is a mystery. Happens @CAPS2 ever it pleases. It puts smiles on faces. Laughter just happens in many ways it can. Although, mine just happened to end up in a crazy situation with a huge mess to follow it. Things got extream, unforgettable. Things you could never forget.  Around two months ago, in the cold @DATE1. It was my @NUM1 birthday. I threw a little party for myself at my house. Though, I was in for a little treat. @CAPS2 everyone arrived they all had a smirk on their faces. Nobody would tell me whats going on. I started to become distraught about it all. Until my buddie @PERSON3 and my boyfriend @PERSON1 walked into the kitchen with a @NUM1 pound bucket full of spaghetti, with a ten pound gallon can of tomato sauce. Next thing I knew my mouth was agape. I couldn't believe my eyes, not understanding why so much of it. Also, why did they have it. My mother walked out and exclaimed ""@CAPS1 up the cars, and let's go!"" @CAPS2 we approached the @ORGANIZATION1, I had a funny feeling in the pit of my gut. I looked around and noticed my sister in law was holding a video camera. Right then and there I knew something was going to happen. Something big, extraordinary, out of the extream and I was right. Spaghetti was flying everywhere, getting in peoples hair, faces. Clothes were getting stained and messy. Not to mention it was cold,wet and rainy outside. The fog made it hard to see who u were hitting and who was throwing it at you. By the end of the noodle war, I looked the worse. Even now the shoes i was wearing are stained. @CAPS2 we got back to my house we had to wash down with the hose. I swore i was going to get sick from the cold water running down my face. I could feel noodles falling outta my hair and clothing, the sauce steaming down my face. Laughing here and laughing there. Everyone was laughing at others for how badly they were covered with noodles and sauce. Eventually, we all got hungry. We decided on nachos. So, my mom poured two family size nacho chips on the table followed by two ten gallon cans of nacho cheese with jalapenos, olvis. You @MONTH1 think the noodle and sauce was messy, well that's where I went wrong. My friend @CAPS3 dropped nachos on my couch. @PERSON3 threw nacho cheese at @LOCATION1, she threw chips at @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON3 tossed cheese at me and ended up on my dog. Let's just say my living room was a cheese fest. I couldn't believe that nacho cheese got stuck in my dogs fer and in all the girls hair. Chip crumbs were in the couch and cheese was on the floor and @CAPS4 tree. So @PERSON3 finally said""@CAPS5 more nachos!""  @CAPS6 on it was cake time. Ginger thought that there wasn't going to be another mess. Well once again she was wrong. They all started singing the happy birthday song, cameras were flashing, my mother in the background crying. She cries on our birthdays because she says its just a year closer to her kids moving out. I figured she would be use to it knowing that she already had two kids move out. All of a sudden there was frosting on my face! I rubbed the frosting off and smeared it on @PERSON1 face. Though he just rubbed it back onto mine. My mom grabbed a plate and threw it at @LOCATION2, she tossed it at @CAPS3 then @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON3 then @PERSON2. Chocolate frosting was everywhere along with nacho cheese. Soon after that we played video games. Of course me being me I played @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @NUM3 live on @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I got irritated with someone on the game and ended up throwing the controller at my television and broke it. Mother wasn't to pleased with me after that. Oh well, we still got to watch movies in the other room. Eventually people started leaving. Saying our goodbyes, ill see you @CAPS6, peace out dude. We said it all. I looked back in the living room and say nothing but huge mess of chips, nacho cheese, and cake. Not to mention my broken t.v. I got stuck cleaning the mess for over three hours. Though, we were laughing the entire time it happened. Having the greatest time ever with each other. If I could I would go back and do it all over again just for the fun and laughs. Laughter is everywhere. You @MONTH1 not see it right away. Though you will @CAPS2 you started laughing your brains out. Laughing puts everyone in good moods and smiles on there faces. It @MONTH1 also make a mess and put things in a crazy situation. You can't deny after them crazy situations that you would go back and do it again. Laughter is the greatest thing in this world we call @LOCATION3."	32
21390	" I think laughter is good for a relationships and here is why . When I first got to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 i was trying to be myself and make friends. One day I was in class and @CAPS4 came into my class room and came up to me and she started talking to me and I started laughing .The she told me that she liked my laugh so she stared laughing like me. So that I would laugh more an @CAPS5 felt good knowing that she was making fun of my laugh she was enjoying @CAPS5 . She was trying to get me to laugh cause she thought @CAPS5 was funny because she had never heard anyone laugh like that. Everyone has a different laugh i have two laughs which she found out funny . @CAPS5 was the best day of my life because i was being myself and I know she wasn't laughing at me. Every time she hears me laugh she laughs and tries to make me laugh so that she can laugh and we all have a good time. For me @CAPS5 is funny because lot's of people don't notice how other people laugh.  @CAPS5 feel good that she noticed and liked @CAPS5 and wanted to have a good time. Most people when they make fun of someone they say hurtful things @CAPS4 wanted to make me laugh again i know she wasn't making fun of me. She just thought @CAPS5 was unique and funny but not a haha you are weird funny but like a omg i love your laugh, its cute and funny. Now every time she sees me she tries to make me laugh @CAPS5 makes me feel good every time she does @CAPS5.When you are new at @CAPS3 good to make other people laugh specially when its not at you directly. To be honest @CAPS5 made me feel like people were startling to like me and not knowing me as ""the new kid"" but as a human being an actual person and that they say me for me not for what i wanna be or for what people see me as. That's all i could really ask for. So my opinion is yes laughter is good for relationships @CAPS5 shows that you have a sense of humor and that there is a actual person inside that body not just bones.  Another reason is @CAPS5 shows your personalty your real self. Isn't that what people, to want people to see them for who they are not what people say there are.At least that's what i want. that's why i will never forget that class period. @CAPS4 showed me that if i just laugh with other people ill know that the aren't laughing at me like making fun of me they are saying that i am funny. That's what people want is to see people for who they are.  The teacher was a substitute for that day and she kept on getting mad at us for laughing but we couldn't help @CAPS5 because @CAPS5 was so funny. That period i laughed the whole time. I was laughing so @CAPS8 that i peed my pants a little. She made fish faces and sounds like she pretended to be a monkey in a tree. She laughed how I laugh she did everything to make me laugh. @CAPS5 was so funny @CAPS5 took up the whole period. That's is how much i was laughing.  I got up and was going to go to the bathroom and when i got back she was still there and i sat down and so she started making me laugh. So then i sat down and @CAPS7 and @PERSON1 came in and there was something in his pocket and i poked at @CAPS5 and said what is that its @CAPS8. We all started laughing cause @CAPS5 was funny @CAPS5 was is wallet. I didn't get why they were still laughing when I stopped but then I continued to still laugh because the way they were laughing. We all were laughing and then we all stopped at the same time and because we all stopped at the same time we all started laughing cause @CAPS5 was funny.The sub came and stood there by us and we all got quit and then started laughing again. I think that the reason why we were laughing was because we were doing dumb stuff. I turned around to do my work and then @CAPS4 spinned me around so that i would start laughing again. Then i started laughing again @CAPS5 I started crying. I was laughing so @CAPS8. @CAPS4 started laughing so @CAPS8 that she started laughing. At the end of the period I had to pee so bad. @CAPS4 wouldn't let me go she just kept on making me laugh more and more. Sometimes just laughing for no reason is the most fun. I guss my whole belief is that laughter is one of the best things that a person can do. Not only is @CAPS5 fun but @CAPS5 is also a very healthy thing to do."	36
21584	" Laughter... what is laughter? Do you expect me to tell you what laughter is? I wish I could but I can't, describing laughter is like describing what water taste like or feels like (besides using the word wet) it's just one of those things that you think its easy to describe to someone because it's a part of your every day life but in reality it's one of the most complex things there could be out there.Even though I can't describe it I do have general concept of it.  Now there's many reasons to laugh or the type of laughter or the feeling behind it. In my case I believe I'm a person that @CAPS1 @CAPS2 laughs once a day. I laugh all the time from my friend falling , hearing a joke , remembering something in the past , from just pure exhaustion (yes I laugh @CAPS1 times when I'm just so worn out and stressed) the list go's on and on. In short I live my life laughing every day. I don't think I'm such a happy go lucky person that makes others laugh alongside her, but I have gotten comments from my friends saying that's the case. This is one of the wonders of laughter if you see someone laughing enjoying their time you just somehow end up laughing along side them. It makes me happy when I hear one of my friends say "" oh @PERSON1 you just made my day..."" why? It makes me happy because I know that, that friend just now I was able to make even if just a little a nice day. One time in my life though I met someone, someone that now I hold very dear, someone who I just can't picture my life without that someone would be right to say he lost his laughter. It was @DATE1, and my friend @CAPS3 had invited me to The @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in @CAPS6 to meet up with some of her @CAPS4 friends. The reunion with her friends was @CAPS1 this coffee shop. I knew no one but her so i felt out of place. So after just sitting back like a wall flower I decided to go to the ice cream shop just next to the coffee shop and when I realized one of the boys in our group decided to come as well. We hanged out he told me about himself I told him about myself as well.  After that day we stayed connected we had long hour conversations through this video calling site called @ORGANIZATION1. We chatted in @CAPS7 @CAPS8 every singled day, and pulled all nighters on the phone just talking to each other. After around a month of talking and staying connected we became more close, close enough for him to talk about more serious matters with me.   Well now this boy I hold very dear to me has had such a hard life. Where could I possibly begin to tell you the hardships his been through. Oh what about the fact that his adoptive ...hhmmm nah many people out there are adopted that's not that harsh for most. Okay what about the fact that his adoptive father abused of him every chance he got and his adoptive mom literally sat back and watched him do it, not good enough? Okay what about the fact that the one thing that kept him going his friend, the one that was all ways next to him. His to say child hood friends, the child hood friend you can do @CAPS9 in the world yet would not judge, would not think the worst of you if you did something to be ashamed of, the one that was willing to stay up with you for days in a row just for you not to cry your self to sleep. That friend of him passed away in a car rec in his second year of middle school. His life consisted of waking up in the mornings walking to school and being ignore by everyone around him. Coming back from school and putting up with your adoptive family screaming @CAPS1 him, called him names ending up to being beaten just because they can.  Do you think he laughed? Well actually he did but, his laugh was not a laugh of joy. Even though he laughed it was as if nothing no feeling what so ever was behind that laugh a robotic laugh. This for me is such a hard thing to stand. It tears me up because this person is someone very dear to me his such a wonderful individual his just now part of my life and I cant see him out of it now. Yet he is suffering he cant even laugh and feel joy. Up to this day I still see him and I have decide that one day for sure I will make him laugh. We laugh when we talk but I want him to experience the laugh he has yet to have experience and I know one day for sure he will."	30
21171	 In the @DATE1 on the month of @DATE2, I experienced laughter on a grand scale. If I recall the memories correctly, the event began on the day of @CAPS1, when my family gathered for a celebration. The day began normally as any @CAPS1, when all were busy attempting to prepare for a feast, and I lobbying around, careless and oblivious to the world around me. Even so, I am able to work with my parents and complete the preparations for that day. It was a sudden burst of joy that finally did me in. A burst of laughter and joy came to me without reason or sanity, I just enjoyed. People, my family, looked upon me with confused eyes, bewildered by my actions and expressions, kept distance from me. Though I continued I still felt a sense of worry, for if I had lost my mind they too would lose faith in my social prowess. For that very day, I noticed a different side to me, a side that I wish would vanish from my being. Never again will I look into a mirror and unto myself, see the sane person I use to acknowledge. The day after the bizarre and unkind gesture I had made among my peers, I attempted to apologize for my actions. Although the first attempt seemed to startle them, seemingly due to the nature of my conversations and excuses made during the short interviews. So onward I continued in my life, again oblivious to my surroundings, yet it differed in my earlier life. I felt a kind and gentle side of myself be released, a relentless stress was lifted from my shoulders and allowed me to continue in my daily life. This is when I noticed another person burrowed into my soul, my alter-ego coming to light and possessing my body. This other being, this alter-ego, I gave the name @PERSON1, and with these new emotions that came with I accomplished great feats. Even today he sometimes comes out in times when I have accomplished feats of knowledge or endurance. He gives strength to me, by providing a promise of laughter to me and all peers surrounding me. I view him, as not another person so to say, however as another part of my being. Never before that day did this other side of me come into light so clearly and with such promise. I do believe that we all have this person, this personality within us, empowering us to drive forth and never look back.End.	35
21090	The @CAPS1 of Laughter @CAPS2 friends and I, always find some way to make each other laugh and have a good time. @CAPS2 friends, @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, are very similar, yet completely different. Both are active, humorous girls. You could almost say they are sisters from how close their personalities match, but it's their appearance that show's otherwise. @PERSON2 is tall and skinny, with short, black, curly hair. Her clear skin has a tint of olive green. Her looks make her seem as if she has a deep secret. The mystery is hidden behind her baby blue eyes. @CAPS2 other friend, @LOCATION1, has sunshine glowing from her hair. Each golden curl ends at her belly button. The freckles, that lightly cover her fair skin, only appear on her perky cheeks. Her eyes seem like the deep blue ocean. You can only imagine swimming in such an amazing color of blue.  One @DATE1 @TIME1, while the sun was setting on a cold @DATE2 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 girls and I decided to learn the @PERSON1 @CAPS4 dance. After a night of practice, I gave up and laid on the full cushion couch, that comfort every part of @CAPS2 body. Two hours fly by and the girls got it. They both had each leg steps and every movement just like @PERSON1. They were so good that they could have been @PERSON1's back-up dancers. After a moment of accomplishment, we realized how ridiculous the idea was and stopped. @ORGANIZATION1 begged to do the dance once more, but with the camera recording. Minutes after pressuring @PERSON2, I started the music and pressed the record button.  The girls were doing great, but started forgetting some of the steps. Out of nowhere, both girls, full speed, run into each other. It was silent, except for the music playing. Each of us look at each other and start dieing from laughter. @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, get up, crying from laughing and apologize to each other. All of this happened with me recording. After settling down, we watched the most amazing home video.  Remembering funny moments like this make me realize how thankful I am for @CAPS2 friends. It makes me feel good to know that we can all be ourselves together. Without them I would not know what laughter is.	37
20727	" Laugher Laughter is to express delight, fun, or a object of a joke. Laughter is something we all do, its a large benefit in our life and it happend on a everyday scedual. Without laughter we couldn't express our happy, out going side, we would have no particullar feeling in life except for frowning, which is a proven fact to cose more wrinkles beacuse of how many more muscles it uses.  For me laughter is a all day thing, @CAPS1 show, my friends, family and, horses are my number one reason for my frown to be tured up side down. You @MONTH1 think horses cant smile, or talk but @CAPS2 do have their own ways of showing a personality that will make you laugh. Shere @CAPS2 are all smart, but @CAPS2 can be clutsy or goofy at times. Mostly @CAPS2 all just make you laugh and giggle like your own little brothers or sisters.  There is this one time that I will always have locked away in the back of my mind. It took place on a @DATE1 mid-day at the beach on the @ORGANIZATION1. I was with my friend and we both had our two horses saddled, ready to go. Both us and our horses felt the energy rush when we saw the waves pouning at the shore with the salty smell in our noses.  Once we hit the sand we were running side by side with the wind wistling past our ears like a moving train. The horses heads were equaly pointed towards the ocean. When we got to the water, the horses pranced and danced arounds like yearlings again, @CAPS2 would walk tell into the water tell it was drenching us both then soon as the next wave would come rushing up, we'ed swerve around and try to beat the wave to the shore.   After about five hours of adventuring caves, sand dunes and starfish we were all worn out, then decided to call it a day. It was around dinner time, so we eat dinner while watching the sun go down to finsih the perfuct day at the beach. We put the horses back in the trailer, and before I shut the trailer door I gave my horse a good pat on his neck, as I was about to walk out my horse tured his head, then gave my a nudge like he was saying ""thanks for the good time"". Driving home I knew this was a perfuct day because of the laughter, and of all the times I just laughed for the injoyment, also my face did hurt a little from smiling so much."	31
20783	                               The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3  The beautiful flames danced so peacefully in the @CAPS1 air. The faint shimmer of the blaze was the only light we had. As I stared at the majestic destruction of the warm, humid air, I felt someone or something watching me from behind. The weight of the sixty pounds of wood started to get heavy as I walked from one side of the house to the other. Finally, I reached the trailer just to be told by @PERSON4, my best friends mom, the she didn't think we would need that much wood. I thought to myself the this was going to be a long weekend. After about two hours of packing clothes, food, water, sleeping bags, pillows, and tents we headed out for @ORGANIZATION1. It would be about two hours of driving, that felt like twenty minutes. @PERSON3, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and I were the worst group of people to put into one car. We all yell and fight and punch at each other just for fun. Once we arrived at our destination, we sprung out of the car like a hive of angry bees. I race @PERSON2 to the @ORGANIZATION1. the second we were done unpacking our belongings. The first few days were spent basking in the one hundred degree heat, swimming, and flirting with the random girls we found around the camp site. We slept as little as possible, so that we could enjoy the friendship and just pure fun we were having. During day two, we decided to go mountain biking. We were on those bikes for hours before we noticed the sun was going down. In the moment we all turned and saw the most extravagant view the earth has ever created. There were burst of orange and red. The colors ricochet from cloud to cloud. After hours of riding our bikes in the heat, we chose to go for a swim. As we swam I felt something touching my foot. Then all of a sudden there was a hand on my foot. When I looked down to see who was grabbing me, it was only a stick. As I looked closer, it turned out to be a root system of a fallen tree. It looked fake, as if someone or something had put it there. This though sparked a conversation about @CAPS2 for the day to come.  The sparks danced together as if they were @CAPS4 and the @LOCATION1. The only light we had was the brilliant glow of the fire. @PERSON3 was playing a gorgeous melody on his guitar. As I listened and enjoyed the flawlessness of nature, I felt someone watching me from behind. I nudged @PERSON3 and when we turned around, our hearts stopped. There was a spinning green light, almost twenty feet in the air. I spoke the word everyone was dreading, @CAPS2. I had slowly stood up and the light started spinning faster. I quickly grabbed the machete, that was next to me, and approached the light. As I grew closer, I could make out small figured in the @CAPS1 shadows. Then, an eruption of children laughing came booming from the direction of the light. A little boy emerged, unable to control is laughter, and ran away. After returning to my seat next to the camp fire, I thought about life. What if @CAPS2 were real and they are watching us. No, there not real. I laughed it off, and continued my week long vacation.	33
20815	                              Laughter                               @PERSON1   Laughter has many benefits that make us have might make us have more distance in between two people or maybe make us have differenceses in between the relationships you have with people. But many other people believe and (think) that laughter is an important part of any relationship with your friends, family ect. Now I'm going to talk about a few reasons of how laughter can be a benefit to us, and how it can also make us have distances from people, or how laughter works in between relashionships we have with friends. Many people think that it's really fun to laugh about simple things and thats me I can laugh for things that might not seem funning to others, but to me they might seem extremely funny. I won't stop laughing for a while. But many other poeple don't consider laughter as funny, as many others. I believe that laughter is an important part of us because it shows people around you the way you are and how you express your self on things. Many of your friends or even your family will know what type of person you are and how silly you can get to be sometimes. Thats the reason why I think it's a great idea or (thing) to do around, just have some fun and laugh. Now talking about relashionship in between people. Do you think that laughter can be an important part of any relationship or how could it help us (ways)????? Well yes I do think that laughter can be extremely important in many relationship we have with people. You get to know and others get to know about you and how you are.  Eventhough many relationships that we have with our friends, family, or with new people we meet. I believe that laughter tells you how a person is and how that person reacts to what other people do or tell them. Laughter expresses how that person is and wheither they are fun people to be around. Laughter even tells you if that person has a lot of humor, just a little, or doesn't have any humor at all. When people don't have that much humor they really don't understand and get the funny parts from jokes or anything. I also think that laughter is really important to any type of relationship you have with anybody, because that makes you know that person a lot better. But other people consider laughter being a reason that distances two people from each other.I don't considerlaughter being a reason for to people to have distances in between. The reasons why I think and say this is becasue their are many people that laugh a lot almost crying and they don't have distances in between other people or anything. They might get more friends or more people to talk to them becasue other people as well might see how that person is and they might see that the person is really fun to be around with. I know this becasue I laugh a lot and that hasn't happened to me. Thats why I don't consider and don't believe that laughter is being the reason to have distances in between people (relationship). In my opinion I consider laughter a very important part of who we are, the way we think, and also the things we like to do. What I mean by this is that you can have some humor but you don't actually express the way you are thinking about what other do. Or if something is super silly and theirs a new kid at school and you or someone else says something you might probably think that it's funny but you might just not want to laugh at that moment becasue you @MONTH1 a little to shy or simply becasuue you might not know that person as well and maybe the other person won't have enough confidence to laugh with you for whatever silly thing someone just said. Although many people still should laugh whenever they want. Sometimes if you laugh a lot you might be the happiest and funniest person anywhere. Or whenever somebody is sad you might as well be the only person theri who can make her/him laugh and happy. In addition these were some of the reasons why i think that laughter is great for you, that way people will get to know you better. These were a few reasons of how laughter can be a benefit,how it can distance people.	31
21009	" Laughter is a natural reaction every human being has when they are either happy or have heard or seen something that is funny to them. It is healthy to be happy other than sad or mad. Laughter is pretty much a sign of happiness, as crying is of sadness. It is just another natural emotion any person is born with. I agree to the quote someone once said about laughter being the closest distance between two people because, if two people get along, they will have many moments in life together where they are happy. It is easy to get along with people who have a good sense of humor as for they won't take everything personally and can understand a joke. Its always good to have a sense of humor because its something everyone appreciates, also, that way people can see that you like to have fun when you know you don't have to be serious. When your with a group of friends that you get along with very well, one of the main things you will hear is laughter. It shows that you get along and that your having a good time.  Of course there are times when its better not to laugh, or when people laugh for no reason, which often gets annoying. Yes laughing means your happy, but when its not needed and is used just to cause noise, it is better to be quiet than annoy everyone around you. In my group of friends we are always laughing and joking around with each other, i like when people have a good sense of humor, i feel more relaxed and its easier to talk to them. Unless, that is, they take everything as a joke and never take anything seriously. Even though it is natural, you have to know when you can and cant laugh. Its a way to show happiness, but in certain situations, it can be disrespectful or rude.  Sometimes when I'm with my friends, they @MONTH1 joke around about a certain person, and once it happened like this;at my friends birthday party, we all went to a bowling alley and as always, were all standing around talking and having a good time. While we were talking, @PERSON3 and @PERSON4 were joking around about something so we all started listening to their conversation. They were joking around about something and then @PERSON3 said something as to turn him down in some way, ask a joke, and @PERSON4 said that hes going to get his heart broken. Right after that was said, @ORGANIZATION1 pitched in, adding again. So it turned out to sound like @PERSON4 was going to have his heart broken again. As everyone laughed at it, @PERSON4 looked at @ORGANIZATION1 with a hurt expression and was the only one not laughing. You see, @PERSON4 had a girlfriend that broke up with him about two months ago, @ORGANIZATION1 forgot about that and didn't mean anything when she added ""again"". She meant it as a joke but it turned out to sound very mean. In this case, the laughter caused by @ORGANIZATION1 was meant for @PERSON4, who was hurt by @ORGANIZATION1's comment. Good thing @ORGANIZATION1 noticed and remembered about @PERSON4's ex later that day. She ended up apologizing for saying something she should have thought through more carefully before saying.  How a person takes it when people laugh at them, has a lot to do with friendship. One time, my friends were driving to a party, or home from a party and were listening to music in the car, one of the guys in the car was singing his heard out to a song by @PERSON1. At one point, while he was singing, his best friend suddenly turned down the volume so everyone in the car heard @PERSON2 sing really loud, with no music. Everyone started laughing because @PERSON2 didn't know that @CAPS1 would turn off the music in the middle of something. Even though it was kind of embarrassing, @PERSON2 laughed along because it was pretty funny. If @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 weren't such good friends, i think for sure @PERSON2 would have gotten mad at @CAPS1 for doing such a thing to him while there where other people in the car aside from just them two. Friends understand each others sense of humor, and know when doing something is going to far, or when the other person will think it's funny too and will laugh along. So as you see, laughter can be happy, thankful, annoying, and or mean, you just have to know when it's okay to do, and when it is better not to laugh. Even though it's a natural reaction, it is one that can be controlled and thought about before doing. Next time someone says something that's funny, first think about if it can be insulting to someone before laughing at it and hurting someone. Otherwise, enjoy life and be happy."	33
21015	" The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 extreme temperatures occur, the situation becomes very dangerous. In my case, the extreme weather was @CAPS1. I lived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 at this time and was eight years old. It happened in the middle of @DATE1, @CAPS3 an almost record high temperature occurred @LOCATION2. The day had peaked at one hundred twenty five degrees @CAPS4, and to make matters much worse, our entire neighborhoods power had gone out. Nobody had air conditioning and many people ended up getting severely sick or injured. We lived in a gated community, and everyone got along great. People from the neighborhood gathered together and put up tents for shade, and provided everyone with cold water. There are important things that you must remember @CAPS3 a situation like this happens, you must have a good attitude, because it's no help to be complaining, also to not think about the @CAPS1, and to help other people who need it. I don't think that our community would have lasted, if it weren't of everyone's great attitude and spirit, and of course, the laughter. It is so important to have a good attitude during a situation like this. What is the point of complaining and getting mad for no reason? I was told that it would not last forever, and to keep my chin up. I could tell that the many other kids, and even adults who were complaining were have a much harder time coping with this situation. It was very hard for me no not complain, being an eight year-old, but I eventually managed with the help of a lot of water. If you keep your spirits up, and interact with people, the say seems to go by much faster. I remember @CAPS3 my whole family was under one of the tents, just sitting around telling funny stories, and telling jokes. I would have much rather had a day like that with my family than a normal, boring one. Out of the many important things you could possibly do, is to not think about the @CAPS1. If you don't think about it, then you will have a much better time and not be complaining. It is important in many situations to keep your mind off the topic so you won't be stressed out. I saw many people there who just couldn't take it. They would only say how bad it was, and it was very easy to tell that they were all stressed out. If you try to make the situation a good one, and not keep thinking about it, then you will get through it, no matter how bad it is. During this @CAPS2 of @CAPS1, many people needed assistance. The community was a big help because they set up tents and provided people with water and snacks. However, it started to get bad, people were suffering from @CAPS1 exhaustion, and many of them had to be put on @CAPS5's. There were several ambulances there to help people out and get them back to normal. Some people did need to go to the hospital and get further attention. The community eventually got through the day with so serious injuries. The power came back on at around six o'clock. Being exhausted the people slowly walked or drove back to their houses. Our whole family walked back to the house and immediately turned on the air conditioning. Everyone was so relieved and happy that we were finally out of that situation. Even at night, the day was at a low of one hundred twelve degrees. We played games and told jokes the rest of the night and were able to get through it all. Our family had stayed strong through the @CAPS1, while many others didn't last. It just goes to show that ,""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."""	40
21628	" I never understood the meaning laughter is the shortest distance between two people, tell I dated @PERSON2. We started to date in the @NUM1 grade. @CAPS6 indeed, you @MONTH1 think it was puppy love, @CAPS4 i still think to this day it was real true love. We lived about an hour a half an hour away from each other and only got to see each other two or three times a month, @CAPS4 it was still the best time of my life, with all the good and fun times we had. We met through my ex boyfriend, and his best friend @PERSON1 @CAPS1. @PERSON1 went to school with me and @PERSON1's mom and nicks mom were best friends, so they grew up together and were best friends as well. To sum up how we met is, I was dating @PERSON1 and was supposed to go to the movies with him and his friend, @CAPS4 @PERSON1 didn't show so I was stuck with @PERSON2 and we hit it off right after that. The more time we spent together the more times we laughed, had fun and as well as that, made memories to last a life time.  If we couldn't see each other we would talk on the phone for hours. (and when i say hours i mean like, @NUM2 hours.) or we would text nonstop. we would make funny jokes, talk crap about people we hated, talk crap about family, and last @CAPS4 not least make fun of each other. we would just have so many good time just talking and laughing our time away. After about @NUM2 months of dating, things went for the worst."" I just cant do this long distance thing anymore"" said @PERSON2."" @CAPS2? @CAPS2 cant we just work things out?"" i said with tears starting to come out."""" @CAPS3 it just isn't far to us."" @PERSON2 said with hesitance in his voice."" @CAPS4 think about all the good times we had? all the laughs and fun times we had?"" I started to smile, just thinking about all those times we had."" @CAPS5 yeah, @CAPS4 is that far to us?"" @PERSON2 Said."" @CAPS6 it is, as long as we have each other nothing it to bad for us. hehe"" I said knowing that he was changing his mind slowly. "" @CAPS7 now i know i need you."" he said laughing in the back ground.After that night everything was good, for a while. we had fights like that on and off and thing with my family and his family made it vary hard for us to be together. @CAPS4 we did it for a year and a half. @CAPS4 even after a year and a half of our life's we still couldn't make it. not ever laughter or good time kept us together. @CAPS4 it did keep us together for that long. Laughter was a big impact in that relationship and i thank god that it was.Even to this vary day, i can still look back and laugh at all the good and funny times we had together.Laughter can keep two people that leave from a far together, @CAPS4 the real question is how long can that laughter keep them together?For a day?A year?Three years?Or maybe a whole life time?Only time could tell."	32
21149	" Laughter is important in all relationships of any kind. If you have a friendship where you never laugh and nothing is ever funny, what is the point? I have four friends that mean the world to me. @PERSON2, @PERSON3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS1. @CAPS1's real name is @PERSON1 but we all call her @CAPS1 because how she acts. @PERSON2 and I use to do almost everything together. We were inseperable, we went to school together, we even ate our meals talking to eachother. @PERSON2 and I can make eachother laugh no matter what the situation @MONTH1 be. I remember when @PERSON2 and I hadn't been getting along like we usually do. One day at around nine p.m. my phone rings, it was @PERSON2 I didn't know whether or not to pick up or to just pretend to be busy so the two of us didn't argue. Well I decided to pick up because it was the friendly thing to do and I knew that she would have been there for me. There was obviously a reason she called me, right? As I was about to say hello I could hear @LOCATION1 crying. I panicked, @PERSON2 was not one to just cry because of something little. I asked her what was wrong and told her to tell me all about it even though we were fighting I wanted to be there for her no matter what because she was always there for me. The @TIME1 before it had been @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, our whole posse or whatever you wanted to call it went together and everything had seemed fine except the usual pointless arguements that always ended in a laugh. Little did we know that the past two weeks @PERSON2's @CAPS3 had been ""house sitting"" he hadn't planned on returning home to his family. As i listen to @PERSON2 tell me the news and how hurt she was, my heart sank. While she cried I cried. Her @CAPS3, broke the news to her @DATE1 @TIME1 after we left for @ORGANIZATION1. He will not be returning home because he hasn't been happy there for awhile and he wanted a divorce. I knew exactly how @PERSON2 felt, my parents got divorced when I was very young. Although it didn't tear me apart like it did her it still effected me. Not having a real family with one home and two parents who were married and inlove was never easy on anyone. @PERSON2 had not the slightest idea that her @CAPS3 would later get married and start a family with a woman he had been seeing for over a year while coming home to his family. She just kept telling me that she had to bring him home, that she couldn't do this. @PERSON2 and her @CAPS3 were really close, she was daddy's girl one hundred percent. I remember her telling me that she just wanted to disappear it was all her fault. All I could do as her friend was listen and tell her it would be okay. @PERSON2 began to calm down and grasp the fact that things happen and she couldn't change her @CAPS3's mind. I invited @PERSON2 over for the @TIME1 to just hangout and maybe get thigns off her mind for awhile. It couldn't be easy sitting in her home with her @CAPS3 gone knowing he wasn't coming back. So @PERSON2 came over, we played guitar hero and everytime I messed up she would laugh. Hearing @PERSON2 laugh again made me feel better about things because I knew that she had figured out it was not her fault for her @CAPS3 leaving. Without the laughter in that room I'm not sure me and @PERSON2 would have been able to ever be good friends again. Afterall laughing at me messing up on guitar hero brought me and her back to being good friends again. So it's very important to have laughter in a relationship because once the laughter is gone then the friendship or whatever you know is going dowhill. Now @PERSON2 and I talk for endless hours or text about anythign and everything and when we aren't laughing we know to ask one another what is wrong."	36
21436	 We all know the benefits of laughter. Many people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Is there anything more to laughter? Can one person be happy without laughing? I have never gone a day without laughing. I know the benefits of laughter. Do you? I know the benefits of laughter. Its truly amazing how something so simple can bring people together, make friends and fix relationships, or make someones day a little better if they are having a rough time. There was a time in ninth grade when my best friend and I got into an argument because I didn't ask him to be on our basketball team for a tournament that happened once a year. After talking it out, and my best friend cracking a few jokes, it had fixed everything. My point is that laughing can release tension, not make everything so serious. Laughing can help you make friends too. Around the world, simple laughter can bring two or more people together. What about enemies? Laughter could possibly show you something you like in that person your not too fond of. Laughter happens to be great for health too, and its a proven fact. What happens when you are really stressed about a test you had recently taken or something different? There are a lot of ways to handle stress, but a really good technique is simply laughter. Try going onto the internet to find something funny that will make you laugh, go hangout with a friend or group of friends, or go and find something else that might have you laugh a little.

20963	"                 Laughter at its @CAPS1  Laughter is one ability that everyone in the world has. Not only does it help you make more friends, but it can also turn your day all the way around. The capability to laugh is a huge importance in this world. Without laughter, days would be dull, sad, and somewhat depressing. When I see someone laugh, it brightens my day, makes me smile, and causes me to laugh along with them. By laughing we become happier, learn more about others, and make our bad days better. I have experienced, first hand, the joys laughing can bring after I have had a bad moment, and that is why I believe that laughter is extremely important to have and to keep in your life.  Not everyone can have a great day all the time. Bad days occur, and when they do, seeing one funny incident and laughing about it is what can turn the whole day around and make it great. Many people hear the statement, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" or a statement similar to that one and will never agree with it. Often times we will scoff and disagree completely. It turns out that I used to be one of those people myself. Most days were not the @CAPS1 they could be, plus having to go to school all day long ruined it a little more. People kept telling me that if I laughed once in a while then I might feel better more often, and I @MONTH1 actually have fun when I participated throughout the day. I never believed them, and why should I? How could one action as simple as laughing change the way I feel about everyday life? The possibilities were just to unlikely. I didn't think I'd change my views on it either, until a few years ago.  It started off like any usual day would, not so great. My hair was a mess, my sister @PERSON1 and I could not stop fighting, and my brand new phone broke right as we started our shopping trip to @LOCATION1. I had decided that the day was going to be horrible because so far, nothing had worked out well. As the day went on, nothing worse happened, but nothing better did either. @PERSON1 and I kept traveling around, going to stores, and shopping. Finally, at our last stop we saw a situation occur. As we were sitting at a stop light, waiting for traffic to move, I spotted a strange man sitting across the road all by himself. The man looked as though he had an injury on his foot, and our suspicions were confirmed when he began walking like a hurt penguin would, barely shuffling his feet and bobbing up and down as he moved forward. The sight of this man made me smile, and when I pointed him out to @PERSON1 she started laughing uncontrollably. Then I too, began cracking up. The man with his crazy way of walking had made me laugh had proceeded to turn my entire day around. What I thought was impossible turned out to be the exact opposite, possible. Laughing could bring you closer to others and make your day more amazing.  As a result of my trip with my sister that day, my views and beliefs about laughing were changed greatly. Laughter actually was the shortest distance between two people. Even though my little sister and I were arguing before the funny man came, after we were done laughing about him we realized that in the span of a few minutes we had become closer than ever before. It is crazy to think that one incident can change your mind about some of your strong beliefs, but it happened, and that day is now a memory that I am going to keep with me forever. I'm happy it happened because as a result of it I have begun to think differently about laughter and the effect it can have on certain situations in my life. I now think of laughter as one of the greatest pastimes to have and do it quite often."	40
21134	                             laughter @CAPS1 funny, normally when i fall of line, for some reason @CAPS1 humorous to me. I'm laughing in my head the hole way down down a rapid.I've taken plenty of beat downs whale I have been kayaking, @CAPS2 i think that my day running the upper stretch of the white salmon might have been my worst beat down yet. I like to call that day the @CAPS5 beat down. @CAPS4 was a very nice day and I felt like @CAPS4 would just be a normal day on the upper white salmon, @CAPS2 oh I was wrong. The bad news started as soon as @PERSON3, @PERSON2 and I parked the car. @PERSON3 had brought the wrong size spray skirt for his creek boat. I had no doubt that we could conquer this problem. the spray skirt ended up barely fitting, @CAPS4 took the strength of all three of us to get @CAPS4 on. After a long hike through an empty creek bed we found our selves at the put in. This is a fairly simple put in, you start off with finding a faltish spot on a @NUM1 foot rock slide. after you find your spot, you simply slide down the rock and of a seven foot drop into water. Unfortunately @CAPS4 wasn't that simple for me, I slid down the rock and of the drop perfectly fine @CAPS2 little did I know I didn't put my spray skirt on all the way so when I dropped into the water about a gallon or so rushed into my boat. I didn't think much about @CAPS4 because @CAPS4 was just a gallon. I actually thought @CAPS4 was kinda funny and that put a good feeling in my gut because that day I was paddling a big boat for my size so I thought @CAPS4 would help my weight distribution a little bit. There for I didn't empty out my boat and we just started paddling down stream.  The first few rapids were no big deal I poked through all the holes there were and I felt like I was doing realitavly good because @CAPS4 had been a while scene I had paddled this stretch. We were about half way through our run when I was starting to realize the magnitude of how gnarly this river was, I was rolling in every rapid I possibly could and laughing my face of every time, @CAPS2 I couldn't quit, there was no way out of this canyon, we had at least @DATE1 foot walls on either side of us, the only way out was down stream! We were nearing the end of our trip and we had @CAPS2 only one more big drop still left to conquer. @CAPS5 falls, a @NUM2 foot drop (depends on who you ask) of pure white water. this drop isn't like any ordanry waterfall in fact this drop isn't really anything like a waterfall, sure you definitely will feel the free fall @CAPS2 the water hydrolics are nothing like a waterfall. What happens on this drop is the canyon gets narrow and when all that water goes over a ledg @CAPS4 creates a hole at the bottom. @CAPS4 is also legged out at the bottom so there's tons of water boiling back up stream, so ounce your stuck in that hole @CAPS1 like trying to paddle up hill and there's basically no way to paddle out of this hole. you just have to hope for the best, hold your breath and stay calm. We were neering @CAPS5 falls and there's only @NUM3 eddies you can catch before the falls so you can scout @CAPS4. Funny enough when I was trying to make the second @PERSON1 my boat got bumped out by @PERSON3's boat and that little bump ended up flipping me upside down and spinning me backwards, at this point there wasn't much I could do about the next few minutes of my life. So I plunged over the falls, I was mixed up in a huge whitewater mess for about a minute and a half, only having brief moments where I could possibly catch a breath of air. I toughed through @CAPS4 and didn't pull my spray skirt because i didn't want to drink from the shoe(don't ask) and because of if I ended up ejecting from my boat there's no way to know what would happen to me in this monster. I powered through @CAPS4, what was only a short minute seemed like a lifetime to me. I ended up getting flushed out down stream and rolling up perfectly unharmed. when I rolled up, I had the biggest smile on my face and my heart was racing. I don't think I would have made @CAPS4 if I didn't have a good attitude coming into this day and having the need to laugh in my head when I messed up. All in all laughing saved my life! 	34
21342	" My alarm went on at @TIME1. It was another normal @DATE1 for all of my friends, but a big day for me. It was time to get up, eat breakfast, brush my teeth, put the last couple things in my suitcase, and head to the airport. For the @CAPS1 time I was going to fly on a plane across the ocean, and it was the last day with my family in @LOCATION3 for a whole year. The next time I'll wake up will be in a totally different place, country, and family, where I have never been before. It will be a new start for me and my life won't be the same anymore. I will be an exchange student on a high school in the @LOCATION1. After changing planes @NUM1 times and @NUM2 hours of traveling, I was finally at the airport in @LOCATION2, where my host parents were waiting for me with a big sign which said my name on it. I was very happy and excited that I finally arrived, but primarily I was really tired. We took off and headed ""home"". My new home was a little green house on a small ranch in the high desert of @LOCATION4, @NUM3 minutes out of town, and without public transportations. Due to the hot temperatures and the dry air I was very tired the @CAPS1 weeks. Adjusting myself took me about a month. Before school started, I visited my new high school and met the school principle. I also got my schedule and signed up for the soccer team, which had their @CAPS1 meeting the following @DATE2. It was good to see kids that will be on my school and in my classes.  Finally my @CAPS1 day of high school was coming up. It was exciting for me, but I couldn't hide that I was very nervous. After a one hour drive to the school I got off the school bus and walked into the building. It felt like thousands of people were in the hallway looking at me. I walked faster. I was hoping my @CAPS1 day would start out good. Finally, I reached my locker, and pulled out the little peace of paper with my locker combination on it out and tried to open it. Even though, I did it @NUM1 times my locker won't open.  ""@CAPS1 spin it @NUM1 times right, go to the @CAPS1 number, go left, pass the second number once..."", I was whispering to myself. The bell already rang, and thankfully a friend that I knew from soccer stopped by and asked me if I needed help. We both started laughing and I was so glad she helped me out or I would have been late to class on my @CAPS1 day. For the next couple times I needed her help again, until I figured out how to open my locker three days later.  Being open-minded, being friendly and smile are three things that are very important in life. Besides that another very important one for me is also to laugh about mistakes I make. More than anything else, coming to a new culture, land and meeting new people gave me a lot of experience for my life. Especially learning how to laugh about mistakes or situations to not get frustrated. Getting frustrated would have made my time harder and not as enjoyable. Laughing makes it easier for me to learn from mistakes I made and to move on. My mom once told me to be courageous to make mistakes, and I don't regret any mistake I made."	40
21123	" When we were little it was watching @CAPS1. In junior high, it was seeing a kid squirt milk out through his nose. But now as we approach our high school years, we stifle giggles, suppress outbursts, and laugh until we cry, for our own reasons; and we can't hold back the inevitable urge to laugh. Some say laughing is the best medicine, unfortunately for my sister an I, this was not the case; laughing just got us in more trouble. No matter how many times we were lectured, someone always found their way back into the other one's room purely because we were nosy. I remember back a few summers ago, I'd seen @PERSON1, my sister, putting a bag of chocolate under her mattress. There was a possibility it was gone, but I had no doubt in my mind that it was still there. But as the mattress was lifted up and as I was beginning to reach for it, the bed was shoved back down, very nearly smashing my fingers. there stood @PERSON1 with a vindictive look in her eyes and two hands placed on her hips. What could I say? What could I do? A shill scream escaped my lips and I bolted for door before she could unleash her wrath upon me. Up the stairs, around the couch, through the kitchen I ran; but not fast enough. Before I could lock myself in the bathroom, she caught my ponytail and yanked, hard. I was in for a nine year old, hair pulling, all-@CAPS2 beating. But lucky me, no more harm could be done because my @CAPS4 had heard my scream and had come to investigate. Fighting was taboo in our house, but that never stopped us. @CAPS4's punishments were minuscule, we could hug and make up, or stand in the corner. The anger in @LOCATION1's eyes was already gone, and a certain, significant smile played across her lips. @CAPS4 was still trying to play the strict parent, but to us, the passed four minutes were just a joke now.  ""@CAPS3,""she had said, one word, one meaning, that's all it took. We exploded in a roar of giggles and laughter. Although there was no way @CAPS4 could have known this, we meant no disrespect, but be couldn't keep silent. Boisterous laughs rang through the hallway, so loud, @CAPS4's words were inaudible. Grabbing our hands and pulling us towards the living room we were half dragged because we were shaking to hard. Ten feet apart we stood, eyes focused on the ninety degree angle in front of our noses. But one look at each other and sent another tremor of giggles through our little bodies. We could have been inebriated if you didn't now any better, but really we were just two rambunctious kids playing around. We all have our reasons to laugh. Maybe your reason is as simple as reading an e-mail that made laugh so hard you cried. Maybe it is because my amateur writing style is a joke to you, or maybe you too have just witnessed a child's nose spew chocolate milk. We all have things in our life that make us want to roll on the floor, or slap our knees; but from my experience it's excruciatingly hard to hold back, so let it out."	43
20911	"            @CAPS10 @CAPS1 @CAPS9 my @CAPS2! Laughter, you need it to survive in this world. Someone should laugh at least ten times a day. Have you ever heard, it takes more muscles to frown than to smile? Well, I believe that it is true. It's more convenent to be happy than being sad. According to me.  In @DATE2, my family was living in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1. My mom and dad had @NUM1 baby girls, before my brother and I were born. It was a beautiful snowy morning on @DATE1... Christmas! My sister, @PERSON1 in a bright yellow dress was @CAPS13 excited to be getting presents and cake! As soon as @CAPS6 opened a big battery powered monster truck, her beautiful clear blue eyes got as big as watermelons!  @PERSON1 walked over steddily, and climbed into the huge truck. There was only one problem, @CAPS6 couldn't reach the pedals. Everyone stood there, silent... then they started busting up laughing because @PERSON1 awkwardly looked like @CAPS6 was dancing in the truck beacuse @CAPS6 was trying to reach the pedals. Then my mom said, ""@CAPS3 someone should go help @PERSON1 get going on the truck."" @CAPS4 that was probably the worst idea ever!  My @CAPS2 is @NUM2 years old, and about @NUM3 pounds, and not in the best shape. @CAPS6 said annoyed, ""@CAPS5 I'll help @PERSON1."" @CAPS6 rolled up off the couch and stood by @PERSON1 and the truck. My dad was giggling in the background. My @CAPS2 said seriously,""I need a stick or something to push on the ""go"" pedal."" @CAPS6 went and found a long stick outside in the snow. They decided that they should try it outside because @PERSON1 wanted to feel the chilling wind on her baby soft face as @CAPS6 was riding in the truck. @CAPS13 my mom bundled up @PERSON1 in @NUM1 jackets, gloves, and a beanie. Somehow they got on top of a @NUM5 foot snowy, and slippery hill we live on. My @CAPS2 pushed down on the ""go"" pedal and it went forward @CAPS4 the front tires got caught on her long dress @CAPS6 was wearing and ran her over! The next thing we know, @CAPS6 is tumbling down the hill screaming on the top of her lungs! That's when her red flowered dress flew up and we could see her tong. My sister said loudly,""That's gross @CAPS2!"" @CAPS9 just some minor bruises and scratches my @CAPS2 was @CAPS5. That was the @CAPS10 @CAPS1 @CAPS9 my @CAPS2 ever! I watched it on the @CAPS11 video.  We @MONTH1 put that video on the ""@CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12."" @CAPS13 if you see it, just remember me chuckling in the back of her head. @CAPS13 remember, you should always laugh or smile more than frown or be mad. Laughter, is the key to a happy life!"	40
20922	" Emotions are an essential part of life. Some emotions bring tears and laughter, which alone are two powerful and essential things to life. There was a time not too long ago that I was able to turn a girl's tears to laughter and made her day a little better.It all starts with the craze of today's teenage world, ""@CAPS1"". Which to those who don't know, it is a website where teens spend quite a lot of time on, and people can comunicate through this website. I log in and see that this girl I like is also signed in, so I start talking to her. The normal teenage conversation of, ""@CAPS2, whats up?"" that sort of thing happens, and then she asks if I am able to hang out. Now, tell me if I'm wrong, but most guys would go hang out if its a girl they like. I went to meet up with her at the library and as always, she was beautiful, even though I doubt she was trying. As I got closer to her, she seemed upset, yet when I asked what was bothering her, she did not wish to tell me. I didn't want to make things worse, so I left it alone. All I could thing about was what could I do to make her happy, so I started talking about the craziest things, not knowing if it would help or not. To my luck, it actually helped, and she started smiling. After a little while, I had her laughing and having a good time. Since that day, we have been dating, and are really happy, and everyday when I see her I say something random to make her smile."	37
21567	"Laughter I've always been one who laughs a lot. It does not take much effort for me to bust out in a laughing fit, the topic doesn't even need to be that funny. I'm not the type to do the ""nervous laugh"" though. I think my laugh fits me well because I am quiet, just like my laugh. I always get a little embarrassed when my laugh gets louder than usual.  The weather lately has been very cold with snow falling here and there. I have just been itching for some good, warm swimming weather. This past weekend my boyfriend, @PERSON1, and I went up to the mountains to play in the deep snow. After a few hours of being up in the snow we headed back down the mountain to go to his house and use his hot tub.Obviously it was very cold and me, being more of a fair weather girl, just wanted to go somewhere to warm up. First we stopped by my house so i could grab my swim suite that I recently ordered off line and was dying to use it.  We left our clothes in the back room and ran out in the cold to get in the hot tub on his back patio. The hot water felt so good; it relaxed my body of ice and my tense muscles. We were in the hot tub for about forty five minutes before we noticed how hungry we were. Since we had gotten all warmed up we decided @CAPS1 sounded good. We jumped out of the hot tub and ran for the back room to dry off and get our clothes on. I had gotten all dried off and started to put my jeans back on. When I put my first leg in my jeans I just had a feeling that I was going to fall. Sure enough, when I got my second leg half way in the other side I lost my balance, tripped over a huge exercise machine, and fell hard on my butt. I started busting out laughing, along with @PERSON1, I was a bit embarrassed but at least it didn't hurt too bad. After I had gotten up and walked around for a few minutes my butt started to hurt more and more.  @PERSON1 kept making jokes about me falling, even though they were pretty funny, I tried not to laugh. He was facing me while we were having a conversation, when we were done talking he turned towards the door to leave and hit his head square on the exact same exercise machine I had tripped over just minutes before. Instantly, I was bent over laughing. I could not move, I was laughing to hard. It looked like it had to hurt when he hit his head, he had a nice red bump under his eye. He didn't find it nearly as funny as I did and just walked out the door. Still, laughing hysterically I tried to follow him out the door but it was hard to move from laughing so much. My stomach was hurting from all the laughing when it finally started to subside.  Still having a little giggle left in me, I walked to his pickup to wait for him while he was talking to his dad. When I turned around to see if he was coming I started laughing again just seeing him walking to the pick up. The look on his face when he seen me laughing again was just priceless. I could imagine why I looked ridiculous to him; sitting all by myself in his pickup laughing hysterically again.  Laughter is one of the very few things in this world that is free. Everybody's laugh is unique and can change due to the situation. There are many different laughs a person can have such as nervous, happy, giddy, and so on. If people can share a laugh it can bring them together. Through out the world laughter is a universal sign of happiness. People of any age, race, or religion can share a laugh. Over all, laughter is just a great feeling."	45
21006	" People can share many things. DNA, clothes, feelings, beliefs, religion, and laughter. For my sister @PERSON3 and I, laughter is what made our relationship stronger than it ever would. When I was younger it was the typical older sister @LOCATION1 younger sister vibe, frankly we did not like each other at all. Through maturing, entering high school, and being part of the same cheer leading organization we have spent almost too much time together and now it's almost as if we are the best of friends. In the @DATE3 we were together constantly. We would watchJerry @PERSON1, laugh and/or make fun of the people who volunteered to be on the show. We would watch clips of the showSaturday @TIME1 @CAPS1, that's where I introduced her to the character ""@CAPS2"". @PERSON3 and I would talk to each other in the voice that we adapted from ""@CAPS2"" and laugh constantly about @NUM1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 is also where we adapted the ""demonic voice"". We would talk to each other, and our friends in these voices. Both of us still talk like that @DATE1. As we entered high school we had to start driving together everyday to and from school. We would listen to music, make up random dance moves and sometimes I would have to steer if her favorite song came on(she was a very energetic dancer). It was all in good fun though. When we would enter into the school everything would change though and I understood that after about a week. I was the annoying younger sister who couldn't say hi to her in the hall or wave at her when she was around her friends. She wanted to be left alone so she wouldn't look weird. She was a junior then, they always think their the coolest around. Once she was a senior she would say hi to me, she would smile when she saw me, I even talked to her and her friends sometime. We also grew closer once I entered the student leadership class that she was also apart of, we had the same class every other day it was hard not to talk to each other.  The single thing that I believe has made our relationship closer because of laughter was the three weeks she stayed in my room. She decided to ""move in"" when she would wake up in the morning with bug bites on her arms and legs and she would have no idea what they were from. We suspected that she just didn't remember getting them when she was out the @TIME1 before, but then when she wouldn't go out she still got them. We figured out what it was when her friend @PERSON2 came over; she had bed bugs. That @TIME1 I separated the two mattresses I sleep on and made her a bed thinking she would only be there for two three nights tops so my parents had time to disinfect her room. That turned into two three weeks. We spend almost every hour of every day together those three weeks, the only peace I got was in the shower. We would stay up late talking about our day, who we didn't like, who's outfit we really liked that day, what we wanted to do in cheer practice and who could have done better at cheering. If you knew @PERSON3 you would know how scared she gets over a movie so half the time when we were up late I was next to her trying to scare her. It's quite funny to see her reaction. Finally she ""moved out"" and I got my room back though I don't think, even now it feels the same as it did. They say many things about laughter; ""Laughter is the best medicine"" ""Laughter is the shortest distance between people"" ""@CAPS5 two people in a room, they'll be laughing in @NUM2 minutes""; All of these talking about how relationships grow with laughter. I have the funniest, silliest, greatest sister in the world because we can laugh at the same things. We have the same mind people say, we do a lot of the same things, we think a lot alike, and we wear a lot of the same things as well. I am positive laughter has strengthened my sister and I's relationship. I bet if you really look at the relationship between you and someone you're close to, the first memory you think of is a happy moment of you laughing."	36
21587	"I think laughter is one of the most important things people need to do in life. The more you laugh in life it makes it so much better and easier. Its better to laugh at something that's bad, like for example falling by someone or even making a simple mistake. It makes life not so difficult and more simple and easy. Laughing can make people happy and enjoy things better and possibly help them look forward to things in the future and help them conquer things that they wanna do in life. One thing that always make me laugh is my family and friends. They make everything easier for me by making me laugh. They don't always say the smartest or funniest thing in the world but it means a lot to me that they do it that. Especially when im not feeling upset or i just happened to not in a good mood, they say something that ll make me laugh and i usually feel a lot better knowing that they made me laugh to make me feel myself again. Most simple things make me laugh more and be happy. Like for example if someone says something totally stupid and know one else laugh's but me. But one thing that normally doesn't make me laugh is if someone got hurt pretty bad, like if they tripped. I wouldn't laugh at that because i wouldn't want someone to laugh at me if i fell and got hurt. I always hate when people brag about stuff that know else knows about that happened to them, like for example if they talk about they did over the @DATE1 and how ""high"" or ""drunk"" they got. Its really annoying to me and also very pointless because when they talk about it I never pay attention or just walk away because all that stuff annoys the heck out of me. Why would i wanna hear about how your ruining your life? Especially at a young age or even at all. Well that's my story and why i think the benefits or laughter is important."	30
21275	" There is @CAPS28 more fun than going to a friends house after church. It is like a comic relief in life after a r rough message to @CAPS10 heart. In @CAPS1, going to your friend's house is even better when your friend is, to say lightly, kind of crazy like @CAPS10 are. Which for my story, could be interpenetrated as a bad thing, but for me it is @CAPS28 but a great thing. My friend and I have had some of the craziest time together, and the funny thing is we @CAPS6't have to be doing anything illegal too! Its such a bonus! We get our giggles from cleaning, playing with magnets, and watching theVampire @CAPS2, and much more. Strange? Yes. Fun? To much. Let me tell @CAPS10 of somethings that have happened to my lovely friend and I . First, like always, there is a @DATE1 and I'm heading over to my good friend's house. Its a very short walk, I leave my church by twelve and am there by twelve o' five. I'm up the steps, I'm to her door, I open it. Bark bark bark! ""@CAPS3 up, @PERSON1,"" @CAPS4 yells from another room. The snowzer pup come and greet me. He knows @CAPS11 better. The one dog eats rocks for @CAPS5 sakes. But @DATE2, @CAPS15 has her reasons to yell, and be a little grouchy.  ""I didn't realize how many dishes there were! My sister will freak if @CAPS15 knows your here and they are not done."" ""@CAPS6't worry, I'll help @CAPS10, and we'll get them done before your sister notices.""  @CAPS7, we are off. @CAPS4 wonders the house frantically for dishes and putting them in the sink. @CAPS7, I work on putting the clean ones in the dishwasher away. We hear a sound from her sisters room, and we jump. @CAPS4's sister sounds like @CAPS15 is waking up but @CAPS7 snorts and the noise ends. @CAPS7 we get back to work. When we got done, we @CAPS21 slumped on to the couch looked at each other. We @CAPS21 were tired and our hearts were still pounding. @CAPS7, her sister snorts again. we laugh hysterically, and her sister tells us to @CAPS3 up. @CAPS7 another day, I come over and we are @CAPS21 really hungry. We @CAPS21 haven't eaten all day long and go into her kitchen. ""@CAPS8 do @CAPS10 wanna eat,"" @CAPS15 asked me. ""I @CAPS6't know. @CAPS8 do @CAPS10 wanna eat, "" I replied back. ""I @CAPS6't know, "" the endless cycle. But, @CAPS7 my eyes cross paths with a bag of chocolate mint chocolate chips. @CAPS4 fallows my gaze and see the bag, and smiles. ""@CAPS9!!"" I'm delighted, "" @CAPS9!!"" we @CAPS21 shout in joy of the idea.  We get everything together, and begin making @CAPS9. Now, @CAPS21 of @CAPS16 are really, ""great cooks,"" so when we were faced with ""who should flip the @CAPS9"", it was a @CAPS11 brain-er.  ""@CAPS10 do it!"" ""@CAPS11, @CAPS10 do it!!"" We argued till I realized the pancake was about to burn, and @CAPS7 I did indeed, ""do it,"" for the sake of chocolate mint chocolate chips @CAPS9. But, when I flipped it, it didn't really want to end its embrace with the hot pan, and broke into pieces. Many ""stupid pancake's"" were said and spread all over her kitchen. But, eventually we ate and were happily full. @CAPS7 came another @DATE1, and this time @CAPS4 had a surprise. ""I found this really cool show!! Its calledVampire @CAPS2!"" I thought for a moment, ""@CAPS14."" @CAPS15 immediately dragged me to her computer where @CAPS15 had them down loaded. I thought to myself, ""are these a cheep knock-off ofTwilight?"" We began watching them and they did seem cool, I liked them a lot.  The vampire brothers were in turmoil with each other, yelling and interrogating each other. ""@CAPS16 @CAPS19 of how her blood tastes!""  I paused the none existent thought in my head, ""@CAPS8 did he say?"" ""@CAPS16 @CAPS19 of how her blood tastes,"" @CAPS15 looked at me. I crack up laughing, ""@CAPS20. I thought he said, @CAPS16 @CAPS19 @CAPS8 her butt tastes like, wow I feel bright!""  @CAPS21 of us start laughing like crazy at the very stupid thing I had said. We laughed the rest of the night with @CAPS16 that. We finish watching a couple episodes and @CAPS7 my mom shows up. I get my coat and the rest of my junk, and head out the door. the dog is still barking, but @CAPS4 comes out the door with me, we give each other a hug and say our good byes. ""@CAPS23 I'll talk to @CAPS10 later, @CAPS4, "" I say heading down the steps ""@CAPS25, see @CAPS10 at school tomorrow.""  ""@CAPS26. And see @CAPS10 next @DATE1!"" I yell from the car window. @CAPS15 yells back, ""@CAPS27!"" @CAPS28 is more fun than that, a friends house on a @DATE1 @TIME1. Especially with a couple of crazies things, like me and my buddy, dirty dishes, a stupid dog, @CAPS9 that stick to the pan, andVampire @CAPS2 with my poor hearing."	40
21615	"                              @ORGANIZATION1                                    @DATE1 for my @CAPS1 birthday we went to @ORGANIZATION1 for a week, @CAPS16 was so much fun when we got there but the drive was not fun at all. When we got to the house that @TIME1 is was so beautiful the snow was falling and @CAPS16 was coming down so hard @CAPS16 looked like white cotton balls and the snow on the house was just amazingly marvelous I mean @CAPS16 seriously looked like @CAPS16 could have belonged in a story book as a princess castle. When we got in the house @CAPS16 was really relaxed and nobody really wanted to do anything we all pretty much fell asleep on the couch.  The next morning when we woke up we were all eating breakfast and watching the snow @DATE2, there was a knock on the door, so of course I had to @CAPS9 get @CAPS16 because my @CAPS17 was ""too tired"" so i got up and went and opened the the door and three huge boys came in and picked me up now at first i was like ""@CAPS2 who are these boys?"" but then after they took their hoods off i noticed @CAPS16 was my cousin @PERSON1, his best friend @PERSON2 and his other friend @CAPS3. So they carried me back to the table and sat me down and @CAPS16 was funny because my whole @CAPS17 was laughing so hard they couldn't breathe and i still had a horrified look on my face.  They yelled""@CAPS4"" and then went out back and started building snow ramps to snowboard off of. So i got dressed and went out back with them and at first they were like ""@CAPS5 great she is out here"". And they usually give me a lot of attention but they weren't so i decided i needed more attention so when they weren't looking i went and sat down and the snowboard ramp the had built and of course @PERSON2 knew why i was doing @CAPS16 but @CAPS3 and @PERSON1 were still clueless so of course they told me to get off but i told them ""@CAPS7"" and that irritated them so @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS8 girl if you don't move i am going to jump over you"", well of course i was super mad at this point and wanted to see if he would actually do @CAPS16 so i told him ""@CAPS9 ahead"" @PERSON1 started to @CAPS9 but then @PERSON2 grabbed him,@CAPS10 him off the snowboard and started yelling at him @CAPS11 the time the whole argument was over, witch @CAPS11 the way lasted almost the whole day. I went to bed @TIME1 and @PERSON1@NUM1 and @CAPS3 went to the bar and the next morning I was told to sleep in but i was woken up at seven o'clock @CAPS11 @PERSON2 and @CAPS3 screaming at @PERSON1 to get up but they didn't get him up they got me up I was so mad I felt like a mama bear who just got woken up in the middle of hibernation. @CAPS16 was so irritating to be a house with three hungover twenty-one @DATE1 old's but i had fun anyways, That @TIME1 they were not home @CAPS14 god but with them not there is was peace and quiet so we played @CAPS15 and @LOCATION3, @CAPS16 was so much fun we had a blast. The next morning wasn't all that fun because we had another @CAPS17, @CAPS18 us. I swear i was so irritated I wanted to pounce on them like and angry tiger getting ready to catch her prey. So i tried to stay away as much as possible, witch was kind of hard because they all love me but i just decided to lock myself in my room for the day to avoid them, @CAPS16 kind of sucked but @CAPS16 was a lot better than having them yell in my ear every five seconds. The day after we cleaned and started getting ready to leave, @CAPS16 was not fun at all but my @CAPS17 made sure i was cleaning and we ate three meals and after every meal we cleaned again but that @TIME1 we went to bed and you didn't hear a peep out of anybody because we were so tired but the next morning we left at seven o'clock and started driving back to @LOCATION2 @CAPS16 was so fun being at @LOCATION1 we have made @CAPS16 a tradition but we weren't able to @CAPS9 this @DATE1 because of winter formal but we are definitely going back this @DATE1 and we will have twice as much fun as we did two ears ago!"	32
21366	" I slowly got up and watched as paint dripped off my face, my hair and clothes. A trail of paint followed me as I tried to hop from one clear spot on the floor to the next, but there weren't many clear spots. All that I could think of, was if I was going to make @CAPS5 to high school, or not. Trying my hardest not to get anymore paint on the ground, I opened the door carefully, and called out. ""@CAPS1...Hey mom?"" I yelled half-halfheartedly, as I glanced back at the ""painted"" room.  ""@CAPS2?"" she hollered back up the stairs.My mouth wouldn't open, I was afraid to answer. I've messed up millions of times, but none have been this bad.  ""@CAPS3, you see... I've had a paint withdraw from the paint pan."" I replied softly, hoping she would not hear me.  ""A paint withdraw?"" she asked in a confused tone, as she walked up the stairs to see what has happened. I closed my eyes in fear as she turned the corner.My mind raced as I tried to prepare myself for a rant about how I have to be more careful, and punishment. Neither came. She started to crack up.  I was @CAPS8 confused at the sight of my mom sitting on the floor, almost peeing her pants. I then realized that I was probably a sight to see. I was covered in paint from head to toe. I started to giggle as I took in the situation, only something like this would happen to me. Minutes later we finial got a hold of ourselves and mom went to go get some paper towels to clean up my mess.  She came back upstairs carrying a role of paper towels and a plastic garbage bags.""@CAPS4 thing I put the plastic covering over everything, before I let you paint."" she stated, smiling at me. ""@CAPS5 would have been way worse, if I spilled the paint all over the carpet."" I replied, returning her smile. I started to gather up the plastic covering, revealing the unsoiled carpet. The garbage-can was as full as a stuffed @LOCATION1 on @CAPS6. After we gathered up the last of the plastic covering, I slammed the garbage-cans lid as I put the last bit of plastic covering in. My mom came in carrying @CAPS7, and a handful of paper-towels.  ""@CAPS8 what made the paint pan have sudden withdraw of paint, @CAPS9?, @CAPS10 you trip on the plastic covering, or drop the paintbrush in the pan?"" she questioned me, as she gave me a confused facial expression.  I didn't know what to say. "" I...@CAPS1, @CAPS3, I was on my way to paint the edges against the ceiling, when I took my first step on the ladder and slipped. Landing in the paint pan and receiving the paintbrush in my face"" I didn't mention the fact that I tripped on my shoelace. My mom always got on me, for leaving my shoes untied. My mom started to laugh uncontrollably again. She started to turn beat-red. I could not believe her reaction. The situation was @CAPS8 funny, I started to laugh again as-@CAPS3. Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined anyone forgiving me in such a big way.  Once we finally stopped laughing, my mom and I finished cleaning the mess. My mom and I remember this day as a time we got to bond. I now realize that my mom will understand, and forgive me for my mistakes, no matter how big they are. "	41
21299	" Laughter is said that it is the medicine for happiness. Those who laugh frequently end up having an overall better life. They are in better moods throughout the @DATE1 and affect people around them with their upbeat mood. Many solid friendships involve laughing frequently. I am lucky to have friends that never cease to make me or each other laugh. Their was one time when we all laughed intently at my house late at @TIME1.  My freshmen in high school was my second year total in public school because I was previously home schooled by my parents. I just established friendships with four other people earlier that year. They were my friends @PERSON4, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3. None of us ever been to eachother's houses yet, so I suggested to be the first one to all have them over on a @DATE1. We did not know yet exactly what we wanted to do at my house, but we knew with our creativity we could find anything to entertain us. As they came over one by one we watched football on the @CAPS1 until the entire gang was at the house. Once the last person, @PERSON2, came to my house we all went outside to find something to do. All of us are football players so we decided to play some backyard football. Unfortunately all of us were linemen except for @PERSON4. The problem was that we had what is called ""linemen hands"" which means that we could not catch a football due to having hard hands. This created quite a spectacle of a bunch of linemen trying to be wide receivers. We ended up not finishing the game because it was way to funny.  Later that @TIME1 we all decide to grab the immense amount of junk around my property ,and like most boys our age, started to fight with them. This battle continued for most the @TIME1 and people got hit in the funniest of ways. After we were all tired from the running around we decided to make scary movie with my mom's video camera. This is when the most laughter of the whole @TIME1 came. We all sat down to make out a plot for our movie and kept distorting it in different ways to come to some agreement on what to base it off of. We decided to make the movie seem like it was off of ""@CAPS2-field"", a movie about aliens invading earth, but we replaced the aliens with a psychopath chasing us. As we began the movie all seemed like it was following the script perfectly. Unfortunately we found out that we could not act at all when the first serious scene came up. @PERSON4 was supposed to be on the ground with a gash down his side when we found him, but when we filmed that scene @PERSON4, who was supposed to be unconscious, could not keep a straight face when we found him. Since he had a goofy smile when we picked him up and with the awkwardly said line from @PERSON3 ""The window is open, @PERSON2 is gone"" we all started to burst out laughing. After we calmed down we went to film the next scene where we wake @PERSON4 up and try to find out what happened. @PERSON4 said ""I'm hurt really bad! I think I need an ambulance"" and then @PERSON1 responded ""@CAPS3 that's not gonna happen!"". That line that @PERSON1 said was not in the script and was just way to funny to keep it in and in a result we all started bursting out laughing once again. We tried to redo the scene, but when I said ""@CAPS4 are you laughing"" we all burst right back into uncontrollable laughing. Later in the movie the last guys alive were @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and me. We were casing the psychopath outside in the pitch-black dark. Randomly @PERSON4 and @PERSON2 run in front of the camera when they were not supposed to. This caused us to laugh yet again because of the way the short fat one ran. After all the scenes were done and we finished the movie, we all went back into my living room, spooked from being outside in the dark for so long making a scary movie. My sister randomly comes home without us noticing. She stares through the locked front door with out making a sound in a very creepy way until we all notice her. We all jumped about ten feet in the air due to being extremely scared. After we settled down we all joined in the laughing once again as we looked back and saw how stupid we were.  In conclusion, the laughing that went on throughout @TIME1 made us closer as friends. Every time we get together at my house we look at that tape and remember the good times and laugh until we cry. The benefit of laughter in my life was being able to create a strong bond with now my best friends. My life is truly blessed that way. END "	41
20865	 It was some day in @DATE1, I was on my way to school. My friend @PERSON1 was walking with me because we both lived on the same street. He lived a few houses away from me but we always walked to and from school together. Well on this particular day i decided to wear a pair of sneakers that had absolutely no traction on the bottom of the shoe and there was snow out. I slipped a few times but never fell. We were laughing because I would be right in the middle of saying something and id almost fall over. We got to school and he started telling everyone about it, I joined in. It was pretty funny because even at school I would almost fall over because the floors were wet from the dried snow. I thought about just walking home and changing my shoes but I would have to wait until lunch because I couldn't leave school until then or i would get in trouble. After first period I found a puddle of water and started sliding across it for fun. My friends tried doing it too but their shoes had too much traction on it. The bell rang for second period to start and I headed to my class. It was fun trying to get to class because I slid around everywhere. Once I got into class the teacher told me we where going on a field trip to the ponds. I was about to skip out on it but the teacher was walking right behind me. We boarded the bus and started heading out to the ponds. My teacher called our names out to make sure we were all there. He must have done it about every @NUM1 minutes. It was pretty annoying. The bus driver was playing country music too, I don't really mind country music but that day I didn't really want to listen to it. I went to get my ipod from my pocket and found out it wasn't there. I had left it at my house when I was rushing to get to school.  We finally arrived at the ponds and we unloaded the bus to begin our field trip. Our teacher told us not to go to close to the ponds because if we fell in we would be soaked and the bus driver wouldn't let us back on the bus. I thought he was just talking smack and I asked the bus driver if he was serious. The bus driver told me if we got wet he would have to wait for us to dry off so we didn't get the seats wet. Again I thought it was a bunch of bull. We met up with our tour guide dude and started listening to him tell us about the history of the ponds and what they are used for. While walking around the ponds I started to slide on the ground. I grabbed onto my friend so I wouldn't fall over but he had pretty bad balance and we both fell over. Everyone started laughing as well as myself. My friend didn't think it was too funny at first. But once he got up he started laughing and joked about how I couldn't stand up right. On our way back to the school we talked about what we learned and if we would want to go back and learn more or even volunteer to work at the ponds. I thought it would be pretty fun if I didn't slip around the whole time. We unloaded the bus again and headed into the school. I found out the little puddle i had found earlier hadn't dried up, I got a running start and slid across it. I didn't fall over this time. The bus had brought us back just in time for the last class of the day, which unfortunately for me was @CAPS1. I got to the gym and asked my teacher what we were going to be playing. He told me we were going upstairs on the wrestling mats to play a dodge ball game. Upstairs on the wrestling mats was a small area and we only went up there if we had a small class. I lucked out big time because we have to take our shoes off when we play on the mats.  I got done with @CAPS1 and the bell rang to tell us school was over. I got dressed into my normal clothes and headed home. My friend @PERSON1 was waiting outside for me. We started heading home and I slide around with every step I took. The sun had melted the top layer of snow and turned it into ice. I looked over at @LOCATION1 and laughed. He laughed too. The whole way home I was skating on ice. It was a really fun day. Except right when I got home I fell on the deck because the step was icy.	38
21086	"               The @CAPS1 @CAPS2  @CAPS3 started out a few years back when I first met my cousin @ORGANIZATION1. For the first time I spent the night at his house, the day before we were outside all day running around his yard and jumping off their roof. @CAPS3 was all very fun and entertaining but no matter what we did @ORGANIZATION1 had something to say about every little thing we did or saw. ""this looks like that!"", or ""she sounds like this!"" @CAPS4 his tone of voice and his unique way of shouting @CAPS3, I could not stop laughing. @CAPS3 was unbearable, @CAPS3 made me laugh so hard and for so long that my stomach would begin to hurt and @ORGANIZATION1 himself would begin laughing from watching me slowly collapse from the uncontrollable laughter.@CAPS3 did not stop there, later that evening we stayed up almost the entire night watching @CAPS1 videos on @CAPS6 and playing @CAPS7 on the @NUM1. The laughter got even greater as we were both becoming extremely tired and our minds were racing all over our thoughts, we laughed until the point where I fell over laughing and holding my stomach. Every word that came out of my cousins imparable mouth made me burst out laughing as if I was hearing the funniest joke for the first time ever.The next morning I had an immense muscle pain in my chest, a sign of a fun and humorous night. even then, @ORGANIZATION1 still had a way to turn my stomach pain into a @CAPS1 subject. The next morning we had breakfast and @CAPS3 was just as fun as the night before. Listening to the nonstop comments and jokes on every thought and every subject and every thought possible. The day continued @CAPS4 the ever-lasting laughter between my cousin and I. Later as I left I though to my self how much more fun I'll have the next time I come to visit. From then on @ORGANIZATION1 and I became best of friends and the times got better and funner. Without laughter, life would be incomplete."	30
20975	" Laughter is a part of life. It can help bring people together or even tear them apart if it is in bad taste. There was a time when me and my cousin @PERSON1 did not really like each other but I had to stay at his house because my mom was out of town. After that night we were closer then brothers and there is one huge funny tale behind it. I was really reluctant to even go over there that night. But my mom told me to stop complaining and to just try to have fun. When I got there we pretty much just watched @LOCATION1 in awkward silence. Then his parents informed us that they were going out and that they would not be home until it was very late. About ten minutes after they left my cousin @PERSON1 turns to me and says ""you want to do something really fun."" @CAPS1 I was at the young age of thirteen years old a could not help but to be interested. So I asked him what this fun thing was and he told me it was a surprise. We left his house and cut through his field to the wall of blackberry bushes that surrounds his field and he showed me a little path through a certain spot. After we got through the bushes we ended up on a gravel road that led to a house that had a lot of land surrounding it. And on the land were what my cousin identified as fainting goats, I had no idea what fainting goats were. So my cousin said he should just show me what they are and what they do. @PERSON1 walked right up to these goats and made a sudden noise, about a quarter of them just fell over stiffened and unmoving. I was roaring with laughter at the fact that these goats fainted when they got scared. We spent about forty five minutes scaring them and watching them faint. No matter how many times we did it, we found it no less amusing then the first time. The funniest thing by far that happened that night, started off when @PERSON1 informed me that he brought an @NUM1 firework. We put it in the middle of where all the goats had flocked to and lit it. It went off and the bang that was as loud as a gunshot. As one entity the goats all collapsed and we were doubled up with laughter, that is until the people in the house came out side. We ran like our life's depended on it, we flew down the road through the blackberry path, trough the field and straight into @PERSON1's house. We sat down on the couch then we looked at each other, we burst out laughing, my ribs were aching from it, I was light headed with laughter. His parents got home about a minute after we calmed down which we also found extremely funny. As soon as they went to bed we burst into silent giggles. That was one of the funnest times I've had with my cousin and even tough we did not like each other before hand, we ended up becoming brothers in all but blood, but we were cousins so maybe even a little bit by blood but mostly brothers in laughter."	36
21142	" Laughter between two people is one of the ways you know if you are really good friends. Laughter between each other is what cheers you up if your having a really bad day. It is the reason you know you have a great bond in your relationship. Laughter is the bond between my two best friends and I. It is why we have been friends for so long. One of my best friends is named @PERSON1 and the other is @PERSON3. I have been friends with them for @NUM1 years now. We are all very close and we do every thing together. We hang out together, we play soccer together, we live close together, and we laugh together. @PERSON1 loves to go camping with her family in the @DATE1. The past @NUM2 years she has taken @PERSON3 and I along. @CAPS2 last trip I had been texting a lot on the trip @CAPS3 i was the only one who had service at the camp site. @PERSON1's mom had yelled at me for texting so much, which had mad me kinda angry. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 had agreed with @PERSON1's mom and yelled at me to. I yelled back @CAPS3 I didn't like how @CAPS1 were all ganging up on me. I said ""I know, I'm getting off the phone. Just shut up!"" @CAPS1 were both really surprised that I said that and became intimidated. We all stopped talking and things were really awkward for a little while. Then our friend @PERSON2 who was also on the trip with us had fallen flat on his face while he was trying to do a cartwheel. @PERSON3, @PERSON1 and I all tried not to laugh @CAPS3 we were mad at each other, but we couldn't help it, it was just too funny. So we burst out laughing together and realized that we shouldn't be mad at each other. We knew there was no way that a little fight like that was going to stop us from being friends. We all hugged each other and said ""I'm sorry."" @CAPS2 is why laughter is such a great thing, @CAPS3 there's nothing better than knowing you have friends that are there for you and can always make you laugh even when your mad at them. It can make your bond between each other stronger and can really repair any damage that has broken a relationship. In my case laughter has fixed many problems like @CAPS2 and always will."	36
21049	"                                 @CAPS2 @CAPS1      The first time i ever heard about the sport @CAPS2 @CAPS1 was the beginning of my freshman year. I was interested in doing it but i wasn't really sure about it. Though during eighth grade i had played volleyball just for the fun of it and really enjoyed it. I had decided i wanted to play volleyball once i got into high school. But when i got into high school my opinion of still playing on the high school volleyball team changed. I realized it was much more then i expected, the people, and the attitudes i realized that if i were to play on the high school volleyball team i wouldn't have any fun. So i started to look into joining the @CAPS2 @CAPS1 team. I had finally decided to sign up and join the team. I had really hope i would like @CAPS2 @CAPS1 because it was my first year on the team and i had absolutely no idea what to expect of it.          The first day of practice, after school i went into the girls locker room, changed and took everything with me and went out to the track shed. When i got out there, i saw a lot of people i had never seen before, except for the kids in my grade and also my best friend. My coach @PERSON1 started to talk to everyone that was new to @CAPS2 @CAPS1. She told us that it would be a great experience and it was a a great sport and also it was more of a individual sport rather than a team sport. But also we did many things as a team. After she had talked and discussed the basics of @CAPS2 @CAPS1. We we're to jog our warm up lap and then stretch as a team. Then we were to start our run for the day and everyday was a different work out either a road run or a track work out. I began to really enjoy @CAPS2 @CAPS1. At first, i was beyond sore and couldn't move at all. But as the season started to really get going i eventually got into shape and looked forward to practice after school every day. We trained and got ready for my first race which made me very nervous i had no idea what to expect my first race ever and i was so scared and nervous. But after, i had ran my first race ever i felt good and was proud of myself. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is something i have always loved every since my freshman year when i first started to run.      One of my most favorite races we've ever done was called ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"" the first time i ever ran in that race was my freshman year, it was like of our third or fourth races of the season. It also happen to be the first time we had done that race in over a couple years. So i was excited for it because i had heard about it and everyone was telling me how exciting it was going to be and that i would love it, the day of the race i was once again nervous like every other race I've been too and still am every since i first joined @CAPS2 @CAPS1. When we arrived at the destination we set up a tent, started to warm up for the each of the races that was going to happen a boys race and a girls race. We also went over the course and that's when i realized what everyone was telling me the mud pits and a huge steep hill and we had to @CAPS2 a river twice. After the race, i had such a great time my team and i laughed and we all enjoyed ourselves. It was so much fun, our bus rides as a team, all the fun practices. As a team we enjoyed many laughs and all the fun times we've had together. My favorite year of @CAPS2 @CAPS1 would have to be my freshman year because it was my best season, i loved it. We grew to love each other and bonded as a team. Laughter was a big part of @CAPS2 @CAPS1 we laughed and enjoyed each others company as we practices and also as we were on bus rides on the way to our meets. We had a lot of fun, and laughed often as a team and that to me was a big part of getting to know my team and being able to bond and build relationships and friendships with everybody on my team. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is a sport where laughter is a big part of running and having fun and enjoying everyone's company, without laughter our team would not be as happy,excited, or even ready to practice. Laughter is big in @CAPS2 @CAPS1 without it our team would not have as much fun as we've had over the years.    "	40
21051	" One of the most oddest things in life is how people can have different ways of doing things for just about anything. @CAPS1 what I see most is laughing. There is that laugh you do when you don't really understand your bosses joke and then there is that laugh that you do when it really isn't the ""right time."" @CAPS1 one of my favorite is laughing at your best friend when your crying. Sitting on the train a few weeks ago, I saw a lady with her friend sobbing about how her boyfriend just recently broke up with her. Quietly turning over my shoulder I try to hear more of the story. Her friend nodded and comfort her. @CAPS1 then said something about how gross it was when he ate. Sort of like a cow eating grass. As soon her friend said this the girls face blushed and she giggled with laughter. @CAPS1 still her eyes were red as she sniffled a little. @CAPS1 a slow smile washed over her face. The woman had more of giggle then a laugh. @CAPS1 you could tell the girl was going to be okay because she had someone to make her laugh and remember life is more then just a guy. I thought for a second how this happens more then you think with my best friend. I feel like now even that seven years have gone by it never gets old when we bust out laughing. Most of the time it's something stupid and we are just strangely thinking the same thing. @CAPS1 then there's other times where it will be like the lady's behind me. One of us is upset and we know the perfect thing to say to each other. Friendship is like that. And laughter is the medicine to any problem.  After watching the two woman I turn in front of me seeing now a teenage boy and girl. The girl looks slightly nervous as she keeps smoothing her skirt out. Then the boy who keeps shaking his knee up an down. And you can tell he's trying to think of something to say while he keeps taking quick sips from his water bottle. The girl finally pointed out the window and said something about when she was a girl she would play soccer there. He looked where she was pointing and said he thought he maybe played baseball there one time. She nodded her head and they got silent again. The train came to it's next stop jerking a little making the boy spill some of his water on his pants. The girl quickly pulled some tissues out of her purse giving them to the boy. His cheeks flushed with red as he started to chuckle and explaining how nervous he was and this wasn't going to help. The girl stared at him and quickly started to smile. Then they both began to look at each other and started to laugh. The boys laugh was deep and echoed across the train the girls was contagious @CAPS1 sweet. Now the ice had been broken because of one awkward moment and had them both talking and laughing. This was the start of could maybe be even young love. I smiled and rested my head on the window. Watching the trees blur by. I knew how our world is always talked about being so melancholy @CAPS1 I think people forget moments like this. It's those brief seconds with another human relating to you. Making you laugh and caring enough to try to make you feel better that keeps our world from completely going insane.  The train slams and starts to slow down as it comes to a stop. I slouch my bag on to my shoulder and get off the train. As I step outside I feel the cool air kiss my cheeks. I looked around see people hurry by me looking for their next bus or person to pick them up. I sit down on the bench and watched the teenage couple holding hands as they walk by me. As they smile and talk everything suddenly goes dark. I throw my hands up to my eyes connecting with another big cold hands. I snap around to see the person who had blinded me. It was my dad smiling ear to ear. I stood up on the bench and hugged him as I started to laugh. My laugh was high pitched @CAPS1 muffled in my dads coat. This was the best type of laugh to me. No action was funny or a friend saying something @CAPS1 because your so happy sometimes you just have to let out a little bit of joy. You just laugh, not for any reason @CAPS1 because your happy. And then in that second everything bad or what you stressed about goes away. Maybe just for a little awhile @CAPS1 it's still something that could make your whole day better."	42
21450	"@DATE1 what a night!! Me and my friends we were going to a @CAPS1 party at our dance coaches work. we had to dress up as elves and play with kids. It was fun, but after we were done with the party that's when the real fun began! After we changed out of our costumes and back into our regular clothes we started taking pictures. @CAPS3 were funny ones,cute one, and weird ones,all kinds of pictures. Anyways my friends and i didn't want to go home just yet so we decided that we should go to some places to take more pictures and have more fun! First stop was a school play ground but we couldn't stay because it was late and we weren't allowed inside so we decided to go to the discovery park i was driving and one of my friends in the passenger seat was taking pictures that turned out really funny. so when we got to the park my friend that was taking the pictures said  @CAPS2 i drive around the parking lot?"" I said sure. we switched spots and off we went. She was a pretty good driver, but @CAPS3 was some scary moments that i felt we were going to die. ha ha. So she drove around and then went to the stop sign by a main road where she decided it would be a good time to switch back and i was yelling at her ""@CAPS3's a car coming we @CAPS2 get in trouble"", but no she didn't listen to me she got out so then i had to get out and we were yelling at each other and my friends in the back seat were yelling also not because we were mad but we didn't want to get caught and we were having a lot of fun. so i get back in the driver seat and we are all yelling "" get in the car"" but she laughing really hard saying "" I wet my pants."" we all started laughing because we thought she was kidding but oh no she was serious she was laughing so hard that she actually wet her pants! It was a good thing she had extra pants with her. So i had to back up the car so she could change behind this big metal thing. As she was changing we thought it would be really funny if we got a picture of her changing so i got the camera and stuck it out the window, but it was really dark even with the flash on so the picture didn't come out! she was laughing so hard that we teased her saying "" keep it in"". We still tease her a lot about it even though it's been two months. When ever we are laughing really hard and someone says "" oh i think I'm gonna pee my pants"" we look at @PERSON1 and say "" @PERSON1 knows what that's like"" we have too much fun teasing her about things she's done.  the next day we go and tell the rest of our friends that weren't with us what happened and they all started laughing as hard as we did. At the time she wasn't in the room with us when we told the rest of our friends, but when she walked in and we all stopped and saw her it was really hard to keep from laughing. now everyone knows about that night and @PERSON1's "" accident"". every now and then we make fun of her but she laughs along because we all know it could have been anyone of us. It still makes me laugh today not as much as it did back when it really happened, but you @CAPS2 still get a laugh on it every now and then."""	35
20869	"                                        A day with the family  One day my cousin, her husband, my mom, my dad and i had gone out to eat at @ORGANIZATION2 for breakfast. They had all grown up together, and telling stories about the old days made them all want to hangout more often. They always had @CAPS2 much fun together. I grew up with my cousins around a lot of the time. We would always hangout. We started talking about all the crazy times we have had, and it was nice to hear abut the old days. We were just laughing up a storm. All a sudden out of @CAPS1 where my cousin @PERSON1 farts. All of us start busting up laughing. @PERSON1 continues to fart while she is uncontrollably laughing. @CAPS2 many people were looking at us in the restaurant. Here was a group of people all laughing, and one of them cannot stop farting. The laughing got louder as well as the farting. my mother could not take it anymore. She took one of the salt shakers and started pounding it on the table. She wanted to drowned out the sound of @LOCATION1's farts. @PERSON1 was beat red. We were all laughing @CAPS2 hard we started crying. We were almost to the point were we were going to pee ourselves. @PERSON1 could not hold it any longer. She finally stopped farting, but now she had to pee @CAPS2 bad she could not even walk. When she got up to go to the bathroom she had to walked there cross legged, and very slowing. All the way there she was still laughing, and we were also laughing. We had fun watching her have to stop every @CAPS2 often @CAPS2 she would not pee on herself. One time that she had stop it was right on these two guys chairs. She just stood there laughing cross legged over these two guys trying her best not to pee. The guys did not really do anything they just sat there waiting for her to go away. We could tell they were very uncomfortable though. I told my mom ""I would be uncomfortable to if i had some random girl bent over me laughing, and trying not to pee. I'm surprised they did not move. i would have"".  Finally @PERSON1 got to the bathroom. Those two guys had left, and when she came out she was glad to see them gone. When we saw her we could not help but laugh. She laughed with us @CAPS2 we did not feel bad about laughing. People were still looking at us, and @PERSON1 was still blushing. She wanted to go @CAPS2 we left and talked about it the whole way home. They were coming over to our house to play bored games. When we got home my brother joined us in a game of gestures. this game is kinda like sherades. We got into teams. I was on @ORGANIZATION1 and my brothers team. My brother went first. He started melting to the ground. I shout out ""wicked witch of the west""! He frowns at me and says, ""@CAPS1, watch before you shout things out."" @CAPS2 i sat there and watched. He did his whole melting thing again,but when he got to the floor he started rolling and jerking around. I was @CAPS2 confused. My cousins shouts out ""poop""! My brother yells ""@CAPS3, why would anyone want to be poop""! We all start laughing,and he just tells us what he is. He was a waterfall.  It was my turn to go, and i got horse. I did not want to be a horse. I did not even know how to be a horse without making sound. I went up there and started hoping around like and idiot. I felt @CAPS2 dumb. My team mates made me feel even worse because they could not guess what i was for the life of them. The buzzer rang and we lost the game by two points. My brother hates to lose. He got really mad, and ran up the stairs. On his way up there he trips on his face, and falls down the stairs. We all started laughing, and that made my brother even more mad. He went up the stairs again without falling this time, and stayed in his room the rest of the @TIME1.  The rest of us stayed downstairs, and played more games. It was a really fun day. I got to hangout with the family, and get a great laugh. hanging out with the family is something everyone should love. It is one of those things that just make you feel good. "	36
21490	  Laughter saved my life. Growing up, my life was pretty normal. Me, my little brother, mom, and dad, all living happily together in a nice suburban area. But two years ago, everything changed; and it seemed as though it wasn't for the better. My parents got a divorce. It was all very strange because at that time in my life I thought that that couldn't happen to me; it was impossible. As I talked to my friends and family about it, I learned to live with the fact that my family would never be the same again. But thought I came to grips with my new life, I still was unhappy a lot of the time. But the times when I was with my best friends and caring family, were the times that I forgot about all of the things going on at home.  George and I have been really close friends since the @NUM1 grade. We are inseparable. Though I have many other friends, he is the one I would always turn to if there's a problem. He knows me better than anybody else. We talk every day at school, we text message each other every night, and hang out almost every weekend. The night that my parents told me they were getting a divorce I called him crying. He told me that in the end it would all be okay, and he told me that he was always there for me if I needed anything. At that point in time it was clear to me that I had something that not a lot of people can say they had in their lifetime: A true friend who would be there through anything with me. He and I would joke about all my problems. To some, that @MONTH1 seem a little strange; but it was almost therapeutic to me. Making fun of my life, made it easier to live it in a sense. It helped me to realize that I need to let go of the past, and that just because there's a rough patch, doesn't mean that the rest of my life is destined to be this way. George knew how to cheer me up, and he could always tell when I needed a good talk, or a good laugh to make my day better.  A girl always needs another girl in her life to tell secrets, to do crazy things, and to lay on the couch all day watching sappy love movies with. For me, its @CAPS1. When we're together there is no stopping us. She was always right by my side through my parents divorce. She was there with me, my last night in my house before we moved out. We sat on my bed in my empty room, recalling all the memories the house had given us. Some would think this would be a sad time, but all we did was laugh. Because all of the memories were good ones.We weren't crying because we were upset; we were crying from laughing about all of our insane adventures for hours. To me, that's a pretty good reason to cry.We re-lived our best moments that night, and we weren't going to let the situation make us upset. We wanted to make our last memory in my house a good one; that we would always remember.  My family is quite strange; but we do know how to have a good time. I don't have many family members, but I think that because we are so tightly knit, we get along really well. Whether we're out in the backyard playing a game of wiffle ball, or in the house playing pranks with whoopie cushions, it's always a fun time at my @CAPS2 @PERSON1's house. During the rough times of the divorce, I would spend a lot of time at my @CAPS2's house because I didn't have to worry about being questioned all the time about how I was feeling; I just had to worry about if I should bring sneakers to go on a hike, or if I should bring my pajamas in case we decided to have a movie night sleepover. That house is a place I still go to just relax, and forget about whatever @MONTH1 be worrying me. @CAPS2 @PERSON1's is a safe haven for me to just let go, and have a good time with some of my favorite people in the world; my family.  If I didn't have all these important people in my life, I don't know what would have become of me. As I grow up, I'm realizing that these people have molded the person I am today. They helped me through the roughest time in my life, and that proves how much they really care about me. Some say laughter is the best medicine; I say it's love. Laughing helps to get you through terrible times, but the people who make you laugh are really what matter most. I can honestly say that every one of these people have made me a better person, and I love them with all my heart.	50
21383	"Many things are said to bring people together. These things can vary from favorite foods to fashion taste or even disliking the same people, but nothing can bring two people as close as a good laugh can. Laughing will always lighten the mood, bring out a winning smile and from time to time, a tear to the eye. Laughing makes the bad days manageable and the great days fantastic. In my perspective, the world wouldn't go around without a good laugh every now and then. By 'good laugh', I @CAPS5't mean the kind that makes you happy for a moment, I mean the kind that brings tears to your eyes and creates a shaking feeling in your stomach. The kind of laugh that you remember. I've had many of those moments, but one that I cherish most just happened to occur during a school day. A couple weeks ago I was having a pretty nice day, sure its @CAPS1 so the weather dampened my spirits a little, but I was doing alright. I had my normal classes, got my average homework load, and then it came time for @CAPS2. @CAPS2 is basically study hall at my school. I sit at a round table in there with a few of my friends and we talk about nearly everything. Everyday, I sit by @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and I occasionally sit and talk with everyone else, but we tend to disingage ourselfs from the others and lock ourselves in our own private world of inside jokes, smart ass laughs and people watching. So that day during @CAPS2, I can't quite recall what we were talking about at our table, we all just couldn't keep ourselfs from laughing. Most of the laughing was just giggles, and some of it was straight up, hardcore red faced laughing. After we all settled down from the most recent up roar of chuckling, @PERSON1 started talking. She somehow spit out the words, ""@CAPS4 it you guys! You're making my eyes hurt!"" amoungst the giggles still blossoming out of her mouth. After she said that, I became puzzled.I just stared at her and stuttered, ""...what?"". I was sure she made a mistake and said eyes instead of stomach, but after she replied with ""@CAPS5't your eyes hurt when you laugh really hard?!"" I lost control. I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe and I felt like I was going to pee! See, the funny part is, @PERSON1 is @CAPS6. So the idea of her eyes hurting from laughing really hard is just uncontrollably funny. After @PERSON1 and I caught our breath, we asked other @CAPS7 around the room if their eyes hurt when they laugh and guess what? They @CAPS8! This only made us laugh harder. This occasion instantly became another inside joke we treasure.That inside joke is by far one of the funniest ones, and it being funny, just makes it funnier! Everytime she laughs I ask, ""@CAPS8 your eyes hurt?"" and we just burst into more laughter. The idea of the joke alone brings a smile to my face, that being the reason why laughing is such a big part in our world. It brings happiness, joy and love. Well, actually it brings just about every possitive emotion. I @MONTH1 not be a doctor yet, but I know I'm right when I say; everyone should get their daily dose of laughter. Laughter can cure just about anything. "	40
21025	"                                  Friendship and Laughter go @CAPS1 in @CAPS1 @CAPS3 best friend and I would spend hours sitting on her bed laughing at nothing. We could tell stories to each other that, to other people would just be stupid, but to us were hilarious. We would stay up all night long watching sad movies and laughing at each other when we caught each other crying. But that was all before the big fight. We have had fights before but none like this. I knew that the decision I would make would ruin our friendship, and take away all of our laughter, but I couldn't let her get away with what she had done. So i said goodbye. @CAPS3 best friends name is @CAPS4, we have known each other sense we were two and have been inseparable sense then. We love to hang out and be together. That was until the fight were I was told that she had been telling lies about a boy and I. I remember the hurt and how disappointing it was to hear that she would do that to me. But I didn't care enough to ask her about it, so I ended the friendship. It hurt but I had talked myself into believing that it was all true. But something didn't feel right, something told me that it wasn't her. But I didn't want to hear it. I ignored the feeling and just went on with life. It was one of the hardest things I have ever done in @CAPS3 life. School was a whole other story, it's really hard to stay mad at someone when you have the same friends and a couple classes together. It was like I had to keep reminding myself ""your not friends anymore, you don't have to talk to her"", like subconsciously i didn't want to end the friendship. I missed talking to her, so one day I said hello, after that we talked nonstop, it was like nothing had ever happened between us. Except there was one thing missing, the laughter. Sense then we have become closer, we hadn't talked about the fight, but it got to the point to where we could occasionally laugh or giggle at something one of us had said, but never the kind of the laughs that we used to share. I never thought that we would have been able to speak, nevertheless be friends again.  After a few weeks we both sighed up for a youth camp. During that camp I found out the truth. We talked about the whole ordeal and came to the agreement that the whole fight had been both of our faults. Mine because I didn't want to know the truth, and her's because she didn't try hard enough to show me the truth. During that talk we shed a few tears and for the first time in about four months actually laughed together. The tension between us broke and fell of our shoulders like a very heavy pack that we both had been carrying. We both apologized for our parts in everything and then went to dinner, and laughed throughout the meal. I realize now that I can't take laughter for granted, it's a very important piece of life and you laugh the most when you are with people you love. Sam and I are still working things out between us but we are on our way to being closer than ever. We laugh all the time and never have a dull moment, we have both decided to work very hard at not having another fight between us. We have both realized that there are two very important things in life and they are friendship and laughter inside of the friendship. I love @CAPS3 best friend very much and I love the laughter that we share together just as much, and I don't want to lose that again. So everyday I'm going to make sure that we laugh as much as possible and I'm never going to take our friendship for granted again."	40
21559	" Though my sister and I have very different personalities, and much of the time do not find humor in the same things we have still shared some humorous moments. It's the times you decide to just go with the flow and enjoy someones company instead of letting it bug you.  One sunny day in @LOCATION1 I had some how convinced my sister to go rollerblading with me. My dad drove us to a park that had a huge pond in the middle of it. The pond was nice in the fact that there was a smooth side walk that circulated all the way around the pond for my sister and I to @CAPS1 on. The pond was not so nice in the fact that it was very littered with ducks ans geese and of course their droppings as well. We always thought of the ponds water as one of the most disgusting things on earth. We got our roller-blades on and carefully stood up. Our dad was going to take a nap in the car wile we made our laps around the lake. As we skated we noticed a man and a woman sharing a date together in a very small boat. They were totally unaware that their boat was tipping strongly to one side. My sister and I thought it would be hilarious if all of a sudden the boat tipped over.We let that thought pass and continued in our rout. On our next lap around we heard a woman yelling. we looked up and saw that it was the woman who had been in the boat. The woman was now standing on the shore yelling at the man to get all her belongings that had fallen out of the boat and were now floating in the gross pond water. The man was waiting in the water up to his chest collecting their items and trying to deal with his upside down boat. ""That date was defiantly unsuccessful"", I thought. We could hardly contain our selves from bursting out with laughter. We roller bladed back to the car as fast as we could. My sister was in front of me and when she tried to stop she couldn't. She basically body slammed the car, fell back, and rolled right underneath it. My dad rapidly opened the door to find me crying with laughter. We pulled my sister out from under the car and drove home.      "	31
20776	"@ORGANIZATION1 is one of the many joys I love to share with people. I absolutely love to laugh, I don't know where i would be if I didn't laugh. My cousin; @CAPS1 and I, are usually together for most of the @DATE1 and the truth is we are not supposed to have energy drinks. @CAPS1's dad; @PERSON1, gave us a monster to split and that day we were going to @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1. After about ten minutes of us drinking the whole monster, me being the one who drank most of it, was the one who was staying calm. @CAPS1 on the other hand, who drank a couple of sips, was going crazy. She was running down the aisles and tripping over her own feet. She almost tipped the cart over with me on the end of it. @ORGANIZATION1 hysterically for no apparent reason is normal for her. Wendy; @PERSON1's wife and my second cousin started to get hungry, so we went to go eat pizza at the @ORGANIZATION2 cafe that is there. My mom had called me and I was trying to get my phone from my pocket to answer while trying to hold on to my plate of hot pizza. I handed my plate to @CAPS1 because my plate was slipping from my grip. She was holding her food in her other hand, she felt the bottom of my plate and said it was really hot so she passed it off to @PERSON1 who wasn't paying attention and he didn't have a good hold on it and my pizza dropped on the floor, pizza side down. It was so embarrassing everybody was looking at us. After that embarrassing moment, @PERSON1 realized that he forgot the churos, so he told @CAPS1 to go get them. All three of us realized his mistake as soon as @CAPS1 left, cause @CAPS1 is a klutz and we probably jinxed it by saying @CAPS1 is probably going to drop them"". We were a little surprised that she hadn't dropped them yet, as soon as we thought that and she set them on the table, one of the churos fell off the table and rolled out of the package. We were @ORGANIZATION1 so hard that we couldn't breathe. @CAPS1 was so embarrassed by her mistake that she turned bright red. We felt bad for poor @CAPS1, but we couldn't help but laugh because of how funny it was. She knew it was funny but she didn't want to laugh at herself. One of the things i usually say is if you can't and aren't willing to laugh at yourself then you aren't having fun. That's why i believe it is so important to laugh cause you gotta learn how to have fun when it is in a situation that you need to laugh at yourself but yet aren't wanting to. That's one of the biggest ways to have fun is by @ORGANIZATION1, because you know you made a small silly mistake that you think everyone in the world saw, all you need is to laugh it off. But you wont cause you feel too embarrassed or too ashamed to admit that you made a little mistake. Sometimes it's your job to go over to them, pat them on the back and tell them that everybody makes mistakes, you gotta learn how to be silly in a tough situation, and that nobody is perfect. Tell them to laugh it off, it helps and you will feel better once you realize that when life knocks you down just get back up cause that's what life is all about. That's the only way you can learn from your mistakes and from life as well. Laughter is really important the more you laugh the better you feel and the better you feel the more fun you will have. Laughter fixes everything, it is a bandage for the little things that happen in life."""	33
21441	" An argument is defined as ""A discussion in which disagreement is expressed."" In many cases, a proverbial ""@CAPS1"" is created between the two conflicting parties. Without a way to bridge this gap, the two groups, or individuals, will not come to a settlement, and continue arguing until one or the other backs down and accepts the others point of view. Laughter, can serve as this bridge. The door slammed shut and I went straight to my room. I had returned home from what had started out as a good time with one of my oldest friends. Looking back I do not remember what it was about, all I knew was that I was not going to speak to him ever again; but being as young as I was, these such thoughts rarely last. I would see him every day during the school week, but it would not matter whether he was there or not. He was absent to me as long as we fought. This seemed like a good plan, to completely ignore each other until we had calmed down, but as with any plan, things never go quite as well as you want them to, especially when you are in the same elementary school, and in the same class.  In elementary school, or at least in my case, there were many group activities, and when you are paired with the person whom you are not on the best terms with, things become difficult. Whether it was to build something, write together, or solve a math problem as a group, communication and teamwork are both important, and us fighting did not effect the group well. We would each discuss the best way to go about performing the task at hand with another member of the group with whom we were not fighting with, and then they would discuss and consult each of us separately. In short, it was a mess, and much more difficult than it should have been. Outside the classroom, the fighting persisted. At recess we would not agree to be on the same team, or even be on the same side of the field as one another. After about a week of this, I realized this needed to stop. At recess, I tried to get him to talk out our problem instead of shouting at, or ignoring each other. The calm resolution to the problem started out well, but being children, ended in a shouting match, to which I lost. I began to wonder if we would ever resolve this. When I got home that day, my mother, being a mother and always knowing when something is wrong, asked me what was bothering me. I was resistant at first to explain things, but, being a mother, she talked me into telling her. She started to go on about how I needed to be the mature one and that we needed to calmly talk out our differences, which I had already tried. I began to tune her out and imagined my friends mother giving him the exact same speech. By the time she was done, all I had received from the lecture was that I needed to try again. The next day at recess, I searched for him with the intent of resolving things today, no matter the circumstances. When I found him and attempted to talk things out, it once again turned into a shouting match. Nearby friends started to crowd and we kept at it. Suddenly, in the midst of the yelling, my friend, with whom I had been fighting with for the last few weeks began laughing. I was taken aback and thought about what could possibly have happened for angry shouting to turn into laughter. Looking around I saw nothing out of the ordinary, only a few snickering bystanders. I ran what had just occurred back through my mind. Just as I reached the point where he started laughing I had realized I had inadvertently made a joke while we were yelling at each other. This realization caused me to laugh, and everyone else nearby to laugh. After we stopped laughing, we sat down and talked things out like we should have done from the start. We questioned why we were still fighting over something as unimportant and trivial as this. After about five minutes of talking, we agreed to still be friends and that we would try to talk things out in the future before shouting at each other. When a teacher blew a whistle and recess had ended, I walked back to class feeling happy, and relieved that we had finally worked things out and could continue being friends. If I had not made that joke in the middle of our fight, I am not sure if we would have made up, even in the event we realized how pointless it was. Laughing during an argument will not solve your problems for you. However, laughter can create a bridge across the @CAPS1, and provide a common ground in which problems @MONTH1 be solved."	41
20838	Iv always loved laughter in my life, I don't know how I could live with out it. This is how it all started out. One day, I was not having a good day. Nothing could have made me laugh. Friends would tell my jokes, they would make funny faces. That just did'nt make me laugh one bit. There was just that one thing they have'nt tried that made me laugh, until my sister completed that one thing. I would never forget this day when my sister and I had a water balloon fight. On a hot @DATE1 day my sister and I would always play water balloon fights, this one time she through one water balloon and it hit my face. I also through one water balloon and guess what happen it hit her face. We just could not stop laughing, we were just breathless from all that laugher. My sister desided to tell me that story when I was not having a good day, even when people tried to make it better by making me laugh. The one thing no one said was that one time during the @DATE1. Until my sister reminded me of it and told me that story. I just start laughing from that day on. Then my sister took me outside, she had all the water balloons ready, we start throughing them at eachother . That day when i was not good day turned out to be the best day of my life. Thats a day I would never forget from laughter. Thats why I love laughter in my life, it just makes my not good days turn to the best day of my life.	27
21553	 One rainy, @DATE1 day in a far away place their was a soccer game.that i was in. I remember that day like it was yesterday.It was the last game of the season,so it was important to me but some things went wrong in the process. I was going to the same like I said. I was just wearing my uniform my aunt said bye as I did. but out of the deep blue shy a big black rain cloud comes out. Oh @CAPS1. so I'm in on the beach thinking to my self the game going to get called off. On it my turn to go in. now in font ready for the for the ball,@CAPS2 I fall on my face. then i fall again coach take me out. so he did, i go back on the beach hopeful the team can do it with out me. game over we lose by two points, its time to leave now but where is my aunt? i called her on my coach's phone , @CAPS1 answer. I think to my self ok shes a little late, but as i look at the time ten go the @NUM1 then a hour. finally shes here. cold, wet and mad from the game. all my aunt said is @PERSON1 don't get mud on the seat. well that's a little hard to do that when it's all over me. my aunt says @PERSON1 you are not going the party looking like that, i said but i have to there is not time to waste. after a little argument my aunt says ok, so i get there and see all that food and all my team mates muddy as me. it's seems like a could move to show the heavens, what a day.	25
20825	 In this essay I will be telling you about why laughter, conflict and trust is very important in an relationship. I have a very good relationship with my cousin. We will laugh, fight but always trust each other with anything. We have known and been with each other for the past @NUM1 year's of our lives.  Her name is @CAPS1. I love her more then anyone else in the world. One thing that does make us closer is that we laugh at each others mistakes. When one of us messes up the other will laugh at them and then try to help with the problem. When one of us does mess up with something we are always the first to now about what it was with or who it was with even if we do not like the other person that they are having the problems with. Conflict, I think is something else that i think is very important in a good relationship. Me and her fight all the time with each other. Even if its for the littlest and stupidest thing's. We always find one way to fight over something. If it's for the other messing up where it could or would completely mess with mine or her life. We protect each other from messing up are lives to much. We stop each other from doing really stupid things. We have strange feeling when the other is hurt or might be hurt by someone or something. Trust is something that is very important for a relationship. Trust, you can be there or tell the someone anything no matter what it is. Me and her now everything there is to now about each other. If you want to now something about me you could go to her and she could tell you. If you wanted to now something about her you could go to me and i could tell you. I could tell her anything even if she is going to be mad at me for a while if I ever really needed her to be there for me I now she would be as soon as possible. We will almost never judge the other for something they did or are going to do. We now what the other person has done and what they have not done as well. I would trust her with my life if I had to. She is my best friend, favorite cousin, @NUM2 mom, sister, and everything else to me. Me and her will always laugh at each other s mistakes. We will always have some type of conflict with each other but we will always be there to help the other one out for what ever reason it @MONTH1 be. those are the @NUM3 thing i think you need to have a good relationship with someone like i do with my cousin @CAPS1. and i still have this relationship with her and i will never be able to lose it no matter how hard i try to i now she will always be by my side.	33
21002	"                            From Laughter to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the first day of school last year, I walked through the doors of the school hoping I would make a friend or two. I was not sure of how this would happen but I hoped for the best. I entered my first class and sat at a table with all unknown faces. I wanted to say something but was afraid of their reactions. The teacher made us play a couple games where we had to introduce ourselves. Those didn't really help. Everybody was tense and it was all awkward. I @CAPS3 wanted to be myself already and make friends. For the rest of the day, all my classes were like that. Everybody was tense and awkward, like something was keeping us quiet. Not knowing anybody didn't help the situation a bit. That was the first day for me. The second day I walk through the school doors determined to make some friends. I thought about what jokes I could say, what interesting thing about myself I could share, but to me all those sounded like stupid ideas. I walk into humanities and sat at a table with a friendly looking girl. The teacher told us to introduce ourselves to the other students at the table we were sitting at. For a minute or so it was very silent, but i wanted to introduce myself so bad. I couldn't stand this silence any longer. I looked in by back pack to grab a pencil and I see a note from my mom saying "" @CAPS4 be yourself and make some friends honey, have a great day at school. :) "". I started laughing because I thought it was funny that my mom actually wrote me a note and stuck it in my back pack. It was so unexpected and I felt like a child. I started laughing and when I looked up, I saw that the girl next to me was laughing too. I knew I had to say something, so I did. I said, "" @CAPS5 my names @PERSON1, but you can call me @CAPS4 for short. Whats your name? "". The girl looked at me, smiled, and said, "" @CAPS5, my names @CAPS8"". Then I asked her what middle school she came from and other questions. We stared talking, we exchanged numbers, and we became good friends. From laughter to @CAPS1, who would have known? A year has gone by and we are still friends. We always laugh about how we started talking. A few days ago I told her how I felt @CAPS2 that second day of school. I told her I was scared to introduce myself. She said she felt the same way and she didn't know what to do either. Since then I thank my mom for writing that note because without it I wouldn't have laughed and made @CAPS8 laugh and I wouldn't have made such a great friend."	40
20931	" Some people say that laughter is good for the soul, and that could be true, but the soul is definitely not the only thing. Laughing is great for your heart and mind too. It can improve relationships, make friendships grow stronger, and even start @CAPS5 make two people who don't know anything about each other, extremely close. You can meet someone new or be with someone you barely know, and just because they make you laugh you feel like you want @CAPS5 get @CAPS5 know them better. I love that feeling. Honestly, you can laugh with any age or gender. You don't both have @CAPS5 be @NUM1 and female, you could be with a little boy, an elderly lady, or anywhere in between and still have a lot of fun. Last @DATE1 I never had anything @CAPS5 do, so I decided I should start volunteering places. The two places I could volunteer at were: a daycare next @CAPS5 my house, or an old folks home about @NUM2 miles away. I thought really hard about it, trying @CAPS5 make the best decision for me. I couldn't make up my mind, and even though I didn't admit it, I felt like they would be just as boring as sitting at home. I finally decided I should do both of them, so I could meet some new people, and have new experiences. I started with the daycare. I woke up at @NUM3 am, and walked @CAPS5 @ORGANIZATION1. I wasn't sure what it was going @CAPS5 be like at all. I didn't even know if i was good with kids. I walked in, and stood @CAPS3 awkwardly. The @ORGANIZATION1 manager came up @CAPS5 me and asked me if i could help out with the @NUM4 year old's coloring room. I nodded my head nervously.  Was i supposed @CAPS5 color for them? @CAPS3's no way they could color a picture by themselves. They're only three! I thought. Oh well, if i follow directions then this day will get @CAPS2 faster. When i went in @CAPS3 all the kids ran up @CAPS5 me with a smile on their face. ""@CAPS1 by me!"" one said. ""@CAPS2 here!"" said another. ""@CAPS3's a spot right here!"" ""@CAPS4 at my picture!"" ""I drew a rainbow!"" ""I drew a car!"" ""I drew you!"" @CAPS5 that, i looked down. @CAPS3 i was, on the piece of paper. A bunch of blue and green scribbles. That day was a lot of fun. I was laughing and having a great time with the kids. I learned that i absolutely adore kids, and I'm actually pretty good with them. The next week a went @CAPS5 the nursing home. I was even more nervous @CAPS3. I felt so out of place. I hadn't found out what I was going @CAPS5 be helping with yet, so I sat on a chair in the lobby. When the receptionist asked who i was her @CAPS5 see, i said nobody. She then asked me why I was here, and I replied, oh, I was going @CAPS5 volunteer. She led me down the hall told me that it was almost time for lunch so i needed @CAPS5 get ready @CAPS5 serve lunch. I did, and then the i heard, what i assumed was, the lunch bell. I gave everyone their lunch with a big smile and it was honestly great. If one of them looked a little down, or upset I could flash them a smile and they would grin back, obviously in higher spirits than before. After lunch, I played a few games of chess. Most people who were @CAPS3 took naps after lunch, so @CAPS3 were only three people out @CAPS3. I played first with a lady who used @CAPS5 be a nurse. I got @CAPS5 know her pretty well in the half hour we played the game; which i won. Next was a guy who was a veteran. He fought in the @LOCATION1 war. He seemed really nice, but serious. I won that game too. The last man used @CAPS5 be a comedian. He was so funny. He told jokes the whole game! Maybe he said a few @CAPS5 many, because he beat me at chess. Well that was my excuse. When i got done, i was in a great mod and i could't wait @CAPS5 come back again. I learned a lot that @DATE1. I found out everyone is alike in some ways, even though each person is unique. I realized you don't have @CAPS5 be the same as the person your with, @CAPS5 laugh and have a good time. It doesn't matter what age, race, gender, size, mentality, maturity, etc. The only thing that matters is that you are in the same place at the same time, trying @CAPS5 make the best of your day. I am so glad i decided @CAPS5 volunteer, otherwise i would have never known so much about people, love, life, and laughter."	41
20746	" In many relationships I have had, there has always been laughter, love, sadness, anger and complacations. Allthough there has been one person I had a relationship with that did not involve laughter and it was reather boring and sad. I would spend troumendous hours of my time to just get one little giggle or sound of laughter out of him. He was a rather gental soul and could never harm a fly, but still could not laugh eventhough he was happy. I would ask many times over and over ""are you sure your happy because you dont seem like it? I never see you smiling or laughing all I see is a frown"" I told him with a sour face and he replyed back ""yes, @CAPS1 I am happy but just becuase I don't laugh doesn't mean I am not and besides with that silly grin on your face, how could I not be happy?"" with that reply I simply just shrugged and began again. ""then why cant you not laugh?"" and he replyed back in a drowsy voice because he was gettig tired of the same topic everyday. ""its not that I can't laugh its that I choose not to"" and I said ""well why on earth would you do that?"" he sighed and huffed really getting tired of the topic. ""allright if you don't stop this"" he said in a gental but strained voice, ""im going to have to stop being so nice to you and I just might not talk to you for the rest of the year"" but of course he was only joking, he could never not be nice to me and besides he was my bestfriend he couldn't not talk to me. The topic was dropped and never brought up again until the @DATE1 I saw him. It was a cold @DATE2 when I walked out of my house one morning to go to school. I saw a big moving rental truck outside of his house and instandtly knew that he had not lied to me but rather did not tell me that he was moving away. I began to think that it was because of me always asking him why he would not laugh but that would be a silly reason to leave. I went over to his house not caring if I was late or never did show up for school that @DATE2, I had to figure out why he was leaving. Once I got to the porch of his house he was walking to the door and I blocked the door way so that he could not go any further making sure that if he wanted to get the box of clothes to the truck that he would have to answer me. I asked him and he said, ""my father got a promotion at work and now we have to move to new york"". I begain to cry as he told me this, I was young about eight years of age and he was twellve. I knew I was not going to get to see him again so I made sure that before I lefted to school that we would hang out before he lefted. That night at the park he told me willingly without me asking him. ""@CAPS1, I know you have always wondered why I dont luagh"" he said and went on ""like I said its not that I cant laugh its that I dont want to...I just...when I was young I was teased because of my smile"". I didnt understand, why would anyone tease him? so I asked ""why though? why would someone tease you, your nice"" and he repled ""because before my new teeth grew in my old ones didn't look so great"". And once again I was still puzzled his teeth looked good to me so I asked again ""then why don't you smile now your teeth look fine to me"" he said ""I would but I don't know after being teased for so many years I just didn't feel the need to and now well...I could smile and truth be told I want to"" I said ""really!?"" with too much excitment. ""yes, and the only reason is you, your about the only person that makes me want to smile, its because of that grin you always have your always so happy. I just couldnt admit it to myself well becasue your a girl and to me I guess having a girl make me want to amile and being my only friend that is younger than me makes me feel a little weak."" I didnt understand this at the time but now that I am older I do and I am so glad that I had that one night to see his smile and many phone calls to hear his laughter. I once heard that laughter is the shortest distance between two people and quite frankly it is absoultyl true becuase after that night our friendship grew even further with just a phone call a @DATE2 and a little laughter."	33
21510	" The thought of seeing him and hearing his laugh never failed to make me smile. I was beginning to accept the fact that this was an urge I couldn't fight anymore. His sense of humor was the best I had encountered and it made my heart run wild. To me, the best piece of a relationship is learning about one another and exploring the little things that make that person who they are. A trait I always search for is someones humor and when I can easily find it, I thrive on it. My story takes place nearly a year ago, while my freshmen school year was coming to an end. I had a suitcase of new memories I planned to carry with with me, but one more was still to be added. I strolled into art class merely @NUM1 seconds late on a particularly average day. The musty smell of rain and old paint settled in the air, something I had come accustom to. Instinct told me to take my seat, so with my headphones blocking the rest of the world out, I did. I paused my music to allow my surroundings to come into focus. A voice with a highly sarcastic tone came from in front of me. ""@CAPS1 to go! You're late."" @CAPS2 the teacher had moved all of our seats, I couldn't help but to laugh at myself as well. However, my seat remained unchanged, the only new aspect was the people sitting around me. I greeted the familiar faces with a smile as class began.  The teacher went on about art related topics that I was far beyond, so by habit I vaguely payed any attention. I was far more focused on the person sitting in front of me. I had never talked to this boy but there was something very intriguing about him. We barley said a few words on that day of class. As the next day approached, I continued my usual pattern of entering the room and sitting in the same place. It had slipped my mind that a stranger was going to sit in front of me. He turned into the room took his seat. @CAPS2 what I had forgotten made me excited. Today was a free work day, a time to be social and work at our own pace. Perfect opportunity for me to learn something not related to art. I casually introduced myself, trying to fit personality into my words. His introduction was far less enthusiastic. Him being uninterested made me thrive to try harder. I began to be myself and act as if I had known him for years, even though his name was brand new to me. It was then I had caught his interest and the conversations started flowing. By the end of that day I hadn't finished any of the work I was supposed to have, but I couldn't bring myself to care. I had just met such an alluring new person.  Each day went on similarly but I had taught myself a good balance of work and talk. I couldn't get enough of this person I had just let into my life. Everything he said interested me and each word pulled me in. I'm positive everyone in the room knew of how funny I found him because of how often my laughter filled the room. It didn't take long for me to become very attached to him and each hysterical thing he said. After a couple weeks, the hour of class wasn't enough for us, and he made the decision to give me a call. I intrigued him as well. So our time spent talking didn't stop at the end of the school day but spilled over into our phone conversations. More time passed and it became a usual thing to talk with him often. I no longer needed to act as if I had known him for years. It was well over a month and a half into our relationship when comfort was starting to set in for me. Although, along with familiarity came a sense of question. I was beginning to very well open up to him but was not getting the same in return. I would tell him something of my past and he would make a joke of it; I would explain an opinion of mine and he would pretend to have the same. I had never laughed so much in such a short amount of days, but it was coming time to feel more then pretend hysteria. I wanted to be able to tell him personal things, but get something from him too. I began to realize I was digging deep into shallow waters.  The amount of laughter in this relationship of mine was clouding my judgment of the person underneath the humor. I couldn't connect with him on anything more then simple things. I still wished to have him be apart of my life, to still enjoy his company, but I had no need to dig deeper. It was time for me find new waters to swim in."	43
20959	" When a day is qualified as perfect there are a lot of things that go into making it so. Most perfect days in people's teenage years are in the @DATE3 beyond the stress of school. My perfect day wasn't in the @DATE3, nor was it on a crazy @DATE4 break in @LOCATION2. My perfect day was on a @DATE2 in the middle of @MONTH1 in @DATE1. It was on this perfect day that my friendship with @ORGANIZATION1 was founded. A friendship that is now the best one of all. A friendship that is based on fun times, memories, story telling, and laughter. By @DATE1 I had spent multiple weekends with @ORGANIZATION1. However none were as hot as that weekend in late @DATE4. We decided we needed to cool off and with that said, we set off for @CAPS1. Down the road we went with two redneck boys and a mutt in the truck bed. Arriving in @CAPS1 was peculiar because I was so far out of my comfort zone. It was also peculiar because I hadn't met a single soul @ORGANIZATION1 was about to introduce me to. When I first lay my eyes on @PERSON1, @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2 I couldn't fathom how @ORGANIZATION1 had met them. She is athletic, driven, proper, and intelligent. The boys that shook my hand were into things like big trucks, fishing poles, and a loud country band. I didn't think upon first meeting them that opposites could attract or become fond of one another. As the day progressed I found my comfort zone again. As the hours flew by and jokes and laughs were exchanged, I realized just how similar we all really were. I didn't think that all of the childish things we did that @DATE2 in @MONTH1 would matter to me months down the roads, but they do. When we were running by the dirty creek with black lipstick painted on as war paint and laughing so hard we cried, I realized just how perfect the situation was. If that day wouldn't have brought laughs to my lips and my mind to it's comfort zone, it would have been a day long forgotten. If you go back on every happy memory you have, there is always one common ground. A joke, or even a funny face makes you laugh extremely hard. Every time I drive through @CAPS1 I think about the day when the sun was hot and we sat by fishing poles exchanging laughs. I think about @ORGANIZATION1 and I running through the trees laughing and tripping over our own feet. I think about @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 laughing and pointing as we attempted to go swimming.  After all of the crazy running and swimming we were quite wound up. @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2 asked us to take a walk; so we accepted and off we went into the brush. Within five minutes of our departure, we stopped walking. Our walk had put us on the top of a hill of little round pebbles. I'm not sure what events lead up to @LOCATION1 pushing @PERSON1 down the hill. However, I remember @PERSON1 pulling @PERSON2 down with him. I also recall @PERSON4 sliding down to join the battle. Watching three boys wrestle and play on a hill of sliding rocks was something like watching a movie about the fifties. Nobody was texting or messing with a machine. Around us was laughing and serenity which danced like music around us. The day had no stress and it had the perfect amount of sunshine. It was like something you only dream about. Once you are in a moment like that, where your own little world is pulling you closer, you never want to leave it. When your on the laughing high, you disconnect yourself and for a few brief seconds your life is in it's simplest form. You are simply you, no racing thoughts, no rushing emotions. You are just one person. I never thought that something as small as laughs could create or better a friendship. On that @DATE2 I realized that the laughs shared between @ORGANIZATION1 and I would be the first memory for what was to come. Every event and every laugh that we had that day will be something I think about when I'm doubtful of the world. It'll always be a memory that makes me appreciate living. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS4 that @DATE1 I wouldn't have believed it but laughing made me closer with people I would have otherwise avoided. Laughs and smiles bounded my world into @ORGANIZATION1 and into the world of a few @CAPS1 rednecks. And as of a @DATE1 @TIME1, that has made all the difference."	45
21146	"    Laughter is one of the many ways to share a memory. It is also a key component to story telling, it shows that the listeners are enjoying what you have to say. When you share a laugh or a smile with someone its almost as if your sharing a deep secret that no one else knows. Laughter is having something in common, it doesn't matter how much money you have or how old you are, a person always has the ability to burst out in laughter. Inside jokes are laughter's best friend, from the second they are made to the slightest mention of them, they always bring smiles and giggles to everyone's face.   As a person, I feel that it is my duty to make people laugh. One example of this would be when I was seven years old and spending the night at my friend @PERSON1's house. We had just gotten done watching @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and were super hungry for lunch. As it turns out @PERSON1's big sister @PERSON2 was the only one home, and she wasn't going to have anything to do with her ""baby sister"", so we were to fend for ourselves. Being young, we didn't want a boring old @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 sandwich, we wanted to make @NUM1 cupcakes! This might sound like a ridiculous objective for two seven year old girls, but we were surprisingly ambitious and tackled this with no problems, or so we thought. In reality it was a disaster, we had no idea what a mixer was so we mixed everything with our hands, which worked up until I brought the flower out. From now on I will never think of flower in the same manner, every time I open the jar of flower all I can think about is the mess @PERSON1 and I had made that day.   Lets just say it was a disaster, enough flower to successfully make @NUM1 cupcakes is approximately the whole bag. As I was getting ready to pour this tremendous quantity of flower into the bowl, I slipped on some of the vegetable oil that had spilled out of the measuring cup, and the flower went everywhere! @PERSON1 started laughing as soon as the white powdery cloud filled the room. As for me, I was still in shock, not to mention covered in what felt like enough batter to feed the entire world. Now that I am a quite a bit older, I don't think I could have taken such a tremendous mess so lightly, considering I would most definitely be the one cleaning it all up. But as a little girl, laughing was the only thing that mattered. @PERSON1 couldn't stop giggling as she was looking at my whole body covered in white. We started to play in the flower, picking it up and throwing it in the air as if it was confetti. When all of the sudden @PERSON2 came down the stairs, took one look at the kitchen and started to yell, ""@CAPS6 and clean this up! I was upstairs for and hour and you manage to make this big of a mess? Mom will be home in twenty minutes and you had better have this kitchen cleaned"" @PERSON1 and I looked up at each other and back at the kitchen. Then was when it hit me just how much work we had to do. All of the sudden I started laughing uncontrollably, it felt as if I had no care in the world.    It turns out that @PERSON1 and I completely ignored @PERSON2 and continued to play in the flower for those short twenty minutes. We were in the middle of building a fort in the kitchen surrounded by what we called ""snow"". I heard the slam of the front door as @PERSON1's mom walked into the house. It sounded like paper towels being ripped right from the dispenser. Because we didn't clean up anything, we in fact made the kitchen much worse, we made a split second decision to run down into the basement to pretend we had done nothing wrong at all. That @MONTH1 had been our biggest mistake, as soon as @ORGANIZATION1's mom saw the kitchen we heard a scream, ""@PERSON1! What is this??"" . Slowly we climb the stairs to the kitchen and @PERSON1 starts explaining herself. I choose to stay quiet because I had never gotten in trouble by someone that wasn't my own mom before. When @PERSON1 is done telling her story, her mom tells us to go downstairs. Both of us are on the verge of crying, when all of the sudden @PERSON1 starts laughing once again. I could think of nothing that would possibly be funny at this moment when she says, "" you still have flower in your hair"".    From this experience I have learned that sometimes, laughing is the only thing that will make you feel better. Even though I have moved away since this cupcake fiasco, I know that if I ever talk to @PERSON1 again we will begin laughing at just the mention of this story. "	47
21039	" Laughter can be a very important thing in everyones life because, its something that can help you in many ways. As far as I remeber laughter has helped me get thru alot of emotional problems that I would have with alot of my ex boyfriends. One day my mom saw me crying because my ex had broken up with me and I got really upset so the only thing my mom said to me was that ""laughter was the best medican""at that point I didn't understand what she was trying to say, but now that im getting older I start to realize what she ment with that is that being bummbed about something like that is just useless, and that I had to live my life to the fullest because I was to young to cry over someone who I jst had a simple crush on and she was totally right about that. But then again its not only for boyfriend and girlfriend thing it's also to keep a healthy friendship with your friends Laughter is a way to show how you feel inside. Even when I dont feel like laughing I still do because thats a way to show people that im a strong and independent girl who knows how to take care of herself and live her life. I also try to make the people around me laugh and just have a good time when we hang out because they create the best memories. I'm accually surprised in how much a simple laugh or smile can make someone feel better and sometimes one person can make another one smile just by simply laughing at the most siplest things.   In the other hand there are people who fake laugh meaning that they just laugh but its not that they are laughin because they think yewr funny they are laughin becasue they think yewr acting dumb. But the truth is that sometimes its hard to see whose the real people from the fake because there are many people who fake laugh just to pretend that they like you when they really dont and i truly think thats dumb because you end up beliving that they are your friends when all they do is laugh behind your back. But i dont let that get to me because those kind of people are the kind that its not even worth to take your time with .When i make the people that i care about smile and just have a good time also makes me happy because it makes me feel like i've made a difference in that certain persons day, i kno i cant change their life but I can always try to make their day a little easier by just making them laugh. My little three month old sister is always laughin, always cracking up for no apperant reason and its kinda funny to watch becasue when she laughs I laugh to, thats kinda what I ment to say when i say that a simple smile or laugh from one person to another can make a difference. i mean shes only three months ans shes always happy and always has a smile on her face for no reason, sometimes without knowing shemakes my day even better when she starts laughing out of the blue which i think its somewhat cute.  My mom sometimes tries to make laugh because she knows that I sometimes have bad days at school and she tries her best to make me laugh because when i laugh it makes me forget about al my problems and everything, but i know that laughin cant always be all good, for excample laughin at other peoples pain is just bad and thats something that isnt funny and people do laugh at other people which can really hurt someone. Meaning in many ways laughin can be good or bad but that also depends in the person who is laughin.."	36
21097	"Social @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people think of laughter as a way of showing how you feel, almost like an emotion. I look at laughter in a different way. Laughter is a form of communication. Sure you @MONTH1 laugh when something is funny, but the truth is that you can control it. So @CAPS5 do people laugh? They laugh to convey a message; basically they are letting you know that what you said or did was amusing to them. Overtime, laughter can build relationships, or even start them, all because when someone laughs at you or with you, you are sharing a common ground. I know that laughter is an important thing in my life because, without it, I would have never met my best friend. When I began sixth grade, I was scared. I was scared that I would lose all of my old friends and become one of those kids who sits alone in the cafeteria every day wishing that he had someone to eat his greasy pizza with. Of course I was overreacting, but the thought was always lingering in my mind all through the first few days. Soon I even began to notice that my friends were actually find new people to hang out with, and I was beginning to feel as though I was becoming that outcast I had feared to be. Then I met him. He was a skater kid with dark hair down past his eyes and white, almost pale, skin. I was with one of my few friends, @CAPS3, when I saw him riding around near the front of the school. I didn't really think much of him besides the fact that he had some of the coolest shoes I had ever seen. I was actually surprised when @CAPS3 walked up and started to talk to him like he had known him forever. I walked with him to avoid the image of being any more of an outcast. As soon as we are standing in front of him, he says something like an insult that I would usually brush off as nothing, but this time for some reason made me really mad. I said things back and before I knew it, we were in verbal warfare. In the end I knew one thing: I hated that kid, and he hated me.  Towards the middle of the year, our school had a dance. It was the first dance I had ever been to and I had butterfly's in my stomach. I got a ride with one of my old friends, @DATE1. I liked @DATE1 because he was never judgmental or anything like that, he was just friendly. When we were in the car driving to the middle school, he told me that he had to pick some else up, which didn't really bother me at all until we got to the house. The house wasn't very impressive it could have been a cardboard box for all I cared. When i saw the the kid's left foot step out of the house I knew exactly who's shoe it was. As he got in to the car, I pretended as if I hadn't seen him. I failed. The whole car ride was nothing but awkward. When we got to the dance I walked on the right side of @DATE1 to avoid confrontation. @DATE1 scenced the tension and stopped walking. What he said next surprised me a little. ""@CAPS5 don't you guys just get along?"" We both stood there, eyes locked, when skater kid made another one of his ""nice comments"". I thought it was going to be the beginning of the year all over again, but I did something I didn't expect to do: I laughed. He laughed too. It was almost as if for the first time ever, we were friends. The whole night we hung out and danced like crazy. We had become friends.  During the rest of the year, we became better and better friends. We went over to eachother's houses and hung out at school. That was when I realized that we were best friends. Even now, in ninth grade we are still best friends. It's crazy how one small giggle can escalate into that, but that's what happened. I don't know how laughter can do that, or @CAPS5 I even laughed that night, but one thing is certain: laughter is important. "	46
21274	" Laughter is important in many ways. It can help you solve an argument with a friend, improve your health, and help in akward situations. All relationships need a little laughter to lighten the mood once in awhile. If we didn't have it, everything would be taken seriously all the time, and there would be many more feuds. One instence where laughter has helped, was when my best friend, @PERSON1, and I were in a big fight about someone spilling paint on a pair of shorts she owned. We were both accusing one another, and the more that happened, the worse the fight became overall. I remember right in the middle of the fight, @PERSON1 made a face that for some reason made me laugh. Once I laughed I could tell she wasn't amused. She began questioning why I was laughing. So I explained to her why I had been laughing, and she ran to the bathroom and looking into the mirror, made the same face that I had been laughing over. To my surprise, she started laughing as well. After the ten-minute laughing fit, I made a joke about the paint on her shorts, and we decided to splatter them with paint for a rather ""unique"" look. Needless to say, laughing saved us from getting into an even bigger argument. When people are angry or upset, physically they probably don't feel that good. They @MONTH1 feel angry for days, which in turn can give them physical pain. I know for me if I'm angry long enough I'll succumb to a headache and ironically, I get more angry at people around me because my head hurts and they're making it worse. Laughing is a way of @CAPS1 things go. Not necessarily being carefree, but learning to let go and live. Physical health is greatly affected by laughter. As well as mental health. Everyone needs to laugh to stay sane. Learning to not sweat the small stuff is really important. My favorite thing to hear is ""let go laughing."" @CAPS1 go of a problem while laughing is the best way to get rid of problems. I've also noticed that when you laugh more you feel better overall. You have more energy, but that's usually from the endorphines kicking in when you have a crazy fit of laughter. But also it lightens the mood tons when you're with other people. All people need to laugh. Married couples, students, teachers, and best friends. Laughing can bring people together. In the end, laughing can benefit you in many ways. It can help resolve feuds, lighten moods, and have good effects on your mental and physical health. And the best thing to always remember is to let go laughing."	40
20976	" Laughter is an amazing thing. Laughter is bilingual. It does not need to be translated or looked up in a dictionary. It is the one form of communication that we all know and understand. Laughter has @CAPS9 boundary.  @CAPS5 was the most taciturn girl in the whole school. In the mornings and during lunch, @CAPS5 would hide in the shadows hoping not to be seen by the world. @CAPS4 @CAPS10 asked @CAPS8 what @CAPS5 wanted to be, @CAPS5 would say invisible. People passed @CAPS8 by without even a glance, thinking @CAPS4 I don't see @CAPS8 than @CAPS5 can't be there. My heart was sad for the poor girl because I knew @CAPS5 needed a friend. Someone that @CAPS5 could talk to, or atleast get a smile from. However, how would I approach @CAPS8? Would @CAPS5 think that I was insane? I knew there had to be someway to get @CAPS8 to talk, or atleast smile. As I walked into school the @DATE1, the hallway was filled with the same hullabaloo as always. Paper air-planes flying one direction and mouths going off in another. I was used to being shoved around and dodging things on my way to class. It was just the fun journey of getting to your @DATE1 period. Finally, as me and my gawky self made it to fourth period, I sat down and began to look for a pencil. As I did so, I noticed someone pulling out a chair @DATE1 to me and sitting down. It was the girl! I didn't even know @CAPS5 had this class with me, let alone sit right @DATE1 to me. I began to be overwhelmed with joy, knowing that this could be my chance. Futhermore, I began thinking of ways I could start a conversation with @CAPS8. I noticed a picture on the front of @CAPS8 binder that someone had drawn. At the bottom was @CAPS8 signature. I asked @CAPS8 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 had drawn that picture. ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS5 said in very quiet voice. My heart was pounding, almost breaking free from my chest. I knew I had to say something more. ""@CAPS2,"" I began, ""I believe @CAPS10 are a very good artist. Do @CAPS10 have any other pictures?"" ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS5 said again, ""however, they are all at home."" ""Is there any possible way that I @MONTH1 be able to see these other pictures of your's?"" I said happily. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS10 would like, @CAPS10 are more than welcome to come over to my house after to school today and see them."" @CAPS5 said in a very joyful voice. ""I would be honored,"" I said. As we ended the conversation, the teacher began @CAPS8 lesson. @CAPS5 was really a nice girl, I thought to myself. I couldn't wait until the end of the @DATE1. When the school @DATE1 came to a close, we meant each other in the foyer. I could tell that @CAPS5 was very excited. I was excited as @CAPS2, because I knew that @CAPS5 was fnally feeling confident with herself; like a baby bird flying away from its nest for the first time. We drove over to @CAPS8 house in my mighty mule of a truck. I became very nervous as we walked to the front door. As @CAPS5 opened it, my pounding heart flew from my chest. The house was absolutely beautiful. It smelled of fresh baked cookies with a hint of cinnamon. I could not believe what was before my eyes. My mind couldn't make sense of it all. @CAPS8 mother yelled from the other room, ""is that @CAPS10 sweetie?"" ""@CAPS1 mother,"" @CAPS5 said back, ""I have a friend over."" ""@CAPS7!"" @CAPS8 mother exlaimed. We enjoyed some cookies and milk with @CAPS8 mother and then we went up to @CAPS8 room. @CAPS8 room was filled with so many beautiful drawings that @CAPS5 had done. @CAPS5 told me that there was a story behind each one of them that inspired @CAPS8 to draw it. @CAPS5 asked @CAPS4 I have ever drawn a picture before. ""@CAPS9,"" I said, ""I am what @CAPS10 call challenged in the world of art."" We both began to laugh; however, we both began drawing a picture. In the midst of it all, I looked over at @CAPS8 picture. It was a beautiful drawing of a fairytale world filled with castles and dragons. Then, @CAPS5 looked at my picture. It was a failed attempt of drawing a simple sunset with clouds and birds. We looked at each other and then began to laugh hysterically. ""@CAPS10're clouds look like potatoes,"" @CAPS5 said. Then we laughed even harder and we continued to laugh for what seemed like an hour. Finally, when i left the house and went home for the night. I realized something amazing, something that I had forgotten. It doesn't take much to reach out to someone that needs a friend. I also realized that it can be the most simple thing that can make @CAPS10 laugh; like a bad drawing. This is beacuse laughter is contagious and we all know that we all love to laugh."	42
20757	"A true story about how two close friends became friends over the joy of laughter. One year their is a boy named @PERSON1 who wanted to so something fun this @DATE1 ins ted of just staying in his room and playing video games all day. So he heard of a play called""@CAPS1 In @LOCATION1"" from a friend and found out if he could join and help out with the play, but he ended up getting a part of the play and helped back stage when ever he could. @PERSON1 found that he enjoyed the doing the play very much and made a lot of friends. At the some time when @PERSON1 was having fun their was a girl named @ORGANIZATION1 who didn't talk much to @PERSON1 at all, but she liked him and she didn't tell a whole lot of people. @ORGANIZATION1 also tried to make as many friends as she could when doing the plays and spent as much time with her friends as she could. As the play stared to end @PERSON1 stared to hang out with @PERSON2 who is @ORGANIZATION1 older brother and stared to pay a little more attention to her and found out from her brother that she liked @PERSON1, but @PERSON1 already knew that she did like him from the way she acted around @PERSON1. @PERSON1 joined another play called""@CAPS2 in @LOCATION1"" after doing""@CAPS1 In @LOCATION1"" because of how much fun he had in doing the first play. @PERSON1 found he already knew most of the people form doing the first play. So he stared talking to the rest of the people that was their that @PERSON1 didn't knew already. This is when @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 stared talking to each other and both of them found that they enjoyed each others laughter they became vary close friends. they became such close friends vary fast because of how @PERSON1 like to make friends vary easy and @ORGANIZATION1 doesn't have vary many friends or close friends or it could have been the fact that @ORGANIZATION1 liked him so much. @ORGANIZATION1 didn't have vary many friends because the kids at school would make fun of her for being so smart and then she go home schooled and lost some of her only friends that she had. @PERSON1 soon found out in their friendship @ORGANIZATION1 was scared of of @PERSON1 not wanting to be her friend because of all the friends she had already lost. By the time that the play was starting to come to an end @PERSON1 had already noticed that @ORGANIZATION1 had liked @PERSON1 before they were friends and he asked her if she did like him she said no at first, but then she felt bad for lining to him and told him the truth about how she did like him and how she thought that is would be best if they just stay as friends. Both of them knew that they could only be friends because of their age difference. @PERSON1 was @NUM1 and @ORGANIZATION1 was @NUM2. So they both knew that it would have never have worked out because of their age. So they both agreed that is would be best if they just stay as friends. As the play was ending the used every minute of it to grow their friendship. By the end of the play they both have became close friends and enjoyed the the good times that they had together and also enjoyed the laughter of one another.  Even after the play both of them still talked when ever they had the time to talk to each other, but they didn't get to see each much of each other. When they had the time to talk they talked about the good times that they had with one another and how much fun they had. They also talked about the great and fun that they had in doing the plays. Both of them agreed that they would do the plays again next @DATE1 and looked forward to seeing each other next @DATE1 and how many great thing that they will have to talk about. End the end I think that @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 are going the be friends for a long time. maybe when they get older they could be more then friends and have their friendship go to the next level......... only time will tell."	33
21470	Laughing is something that everyone experiences. It changes situations from bad to funny. It's like magic. I mean you don't need a wand or anything, just a twisted sense of humor. You just need a little common sense and a little bit of illogical thinking. I know that those are two entirely different things but isn't that what makes us @CAPS4? isn't laughter just the response to hearing something illogical that differs from your common sense? No. It's not. Laughter is also an extremely helpful tool. you can do a lot of things with laughter. you can get out of trouble, get into trouble, start a friendship, end a friendship, get a job, lose a job, win a game and, lose a game. and that's not everything, mind you. But I'm not here to talk about all of those things, just one of them. making friends with laughter. just sit back and listen and maybe you'll learn something.Before we begin the story, let me just start by saying that I'm not exactly the nicest guy on the planet, and i know this, but I'm good at making people @CAPS4. It's not even on purpose half of the time. the majority of my jokes and humor consists of depressing things. I honestly think that I get that response from people because they don't know how else to react. And this is why @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or whoever invented sadists and masochists. Anyway lets get back on track. Once upon a time where teens were desensitized to the harsh reality of modern living there was a kid. that kids name was @PERSON1. now I really hadn't known @PERSON1 for very long and, to be quite honest, i didn't really want to but he tagged along with me and grant and @PERSON3 back in the day. he always wore these awesome iron maiden t-shirts and listened to the type of music that i liked so i guess you could say it was fated but that's neither here nor there. One day we got to talking. We were both thinking about this big barrel that had been left in the track at our school. it was empty and plastic and when you're @NUM1 everything big and red and plastic looks fun. we decided that we would take the barrel and stand on it. Yes that was all we wanted to do with it. It never really crossed our minds that we could have taken it or built something with it. no, the only upstanding conclusion we could come to was to stand on it. and we did. and it was fun.  the next day we came to school and @PERSON1 was handing out invitations to his birthday party. i was pretty excited so i went. as it turns out, our lives are very very much alike. i think the first thing i noticed when i went to his house was the kitchen. it was like they took my kitchen and painted it a different color and then put it there. honestly i thought i was the only kid who lived the way i did. i used to get mad because my mom wouldn't ever buy matching dishes or silverware because we never really had the money and this kid had the most random assortment of dishes and such in his house. collectible versions of different pint glasses, mismatched silverware, logical dish placement. i know it sounds stupid but it used to make me happy.  When the other guys arrived we started to talk, or at least i did. we talked about some random stuff too like @CAPS3 videos and good movies we had seen recently. @PERSON1 and i always ended up talking about other stuff like travel and the future and dogs but that's just because we agreed that newer movies kind of sucked, too many explosions and not enough character development. eventually we started a fire and moved our conversations outside. see, it always seems like things are better when you look into the fire. and when the fire goes out, you want that feeling again. well i was prepared to fix it but everybody went inside except me and @PERSON2 (another guy at the party) so we decided to play around a bit. we went into @PERSON1 garage and found his @NUM2 and brake fluid. we sprayed it on the fire and i think my face got a little sunburned after that. The flames had gotten so close to my face that i could feel my eyelashes burning on the tips. Then we grabbed some more wood and dropped it on the fire. everybody came back outside to play around with it. i know I'm kind of a bad influence but when life gives you an opportunity to do something fun, you can't pass it up. We spent the rest of the night talking about girls and cracking jokes. I just wish we had a @CAPS4-@CAPS5-@CAPS6. That night, i made some eternal friends.	36
21560	" When I told my mom that I wanted to @CAPS5 from sunset to sunrise to raise money for a trip to @LOCATION1, she laughed. Her laugh was one of utter sarcasm, as if she was saying, ""Is this a joke?"". Yet, when the crazy idea of running for @NUM1 hours straight was truly thought through, the laughter began to melt away. The idea made sense; I wanted to go to @LOCATION1 with my school's band with a cost of roughly @MONEY1. My family didn't have that money, and I certainly wasn't going to bribe my neighbors penny by penny to buy cheap cookie dough from a magazine. I needed to earn my money, in a way that not only was meaningful, but also efficient. What better way to do that then to do a long distance @CAPS5; a skill that I not only loved, but was also good at? The plan started small; I would @CAPS5 from sunset to sunrise with some friends, wanting to raise about @MONEY2. After consulting my distance coach, I realized that running for @NUM1 hours would entitle me to over @NUM3 consecutive miles.So what if I was fifteen years old and had never even ran a marathon before? Something in me told me it was possible. And so we laid out the plan; I was to @CAPS5 about @NUM4 miles a week, with three hour runs on @DATE3. I ran about ten miles a day, including hill repeats, running backwards, and many, many lunges. For some reason, both my coach and I agreed that I could do it.  Running was one thing, but then there was the reason behind the running; raising money. A family friend, @PERSON1, who was both a runner and an organization whiz, helped me out. When I informed him that my goal was to raise @MONEY2, he looked at me and firmly said that I could do better. We started out with local businesses, asking for things ranging from bananas to an energy gel called ""@CAPS1"". @PERSON1 taught me how to dress, talk, and present to each business, helping me create a flier to put up in coffee houses, and a way to organize the money I brought in. Next, came the friends. Surprisingly, I found that a lot of my friends not only wanted to donate, but also wanted to participate in the all-@CAPS4 @CAPS5, and thus was created the running ""shifts"". Soon, I had about twenty people who were going to @CAPS5 with me, ten businesses who sponsoring me, and four ""drivers"" who drove cars with mattresses, food, and water in the back to support me and my ""crew"". Before I knew it, my whole community was cheering me and that crazy, laughable idea on. The @CAPS4 of the ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 All-@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" came before I knew it. The day before my stomach was twisted in knots, and it almost impossible to rest. Yet, as people arrived ready to @CAPS5, drive, and cheer the whole event on, my fears began to subside. The weather was wonderful, with clear skies and decently warm temperatures for early @DATE4, and everybody who came were cheerful and encouraging. As the sun set on that fateful day of @DATE1, a group of roughly twenty teenagers all with a crazy goal and strong spirits, set off from my home in an awkward jog, knowing that they would return when the sun rose the next day having conquered something almost impossible. As we ran, headlamps were turned on, music was cranked up, quirky runner games played to pass the time, and silly songs were sung to keep our feet moving in the briskly cool @CAPS4. The hardest part for me was returning to my home after @NUM5 miles for a bathroom break around @TIME1 and realizing that I still had seven hours left. As the miles and minutes began to blend together in the seemingly endless @CAPS4, it became hard for me to believe that the sun would ever rise again. We all wanted so badly just to stop, rest, and sleep. That @CAPS4, with our feet pounding the cold pavement, we ran like shadows through the endless @CAPS4, our eyes searching for the sunrise that would signify our time to stop.  The sunrise that rose the morning of @DATE2 at @NUM6 am was the most welcoming sight I had ever seen. @NUM7 miles behind me, and well over @NUM8 for each person in my group, we were all exhausted and cold to the bone. Everyone who had been resting jumped out of the support cars and joined me for the last mile, every one of us watching with awe as light seeped into the darkness, stunning the quiet, frost-covered world on with warm light. The sun rose big and orange, and when my feet finally stopped, an exhausted yet exuberant shout left the throats of everyone. It was then, in that gorgeous sunrise, that me and mom hugged and laughed; a laugh that was not sarcastic, but spoke of how a girl who had done the impossible."	44
21233	"                            Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4  @CAPS1 your little, your exactly that, little. You look up at everyone with not a faint clue of @CAPS6 to do anything. Now, this is usually @CAPS1 your parents step in. They feed, and love and take care of you, but @CAPS4 importantly, they teach you what you need to know. Growing up I've learned that you need to help others, not just yourself. One way I find easy for me to help others is with laughter. Laughter isn't something that just effects the people around you, @CAPS2 also effects you. You can ask anyone if once in they're life anyone has ever made a difference by making them laugh. Or could have made a difference my making them laugh. @CAPS4 will be able to think of a time this has happened, some @MONTH1 not. Though I know for a fact, someone has made a difference in my life just by making me giggle. For instance, I remember a day @CAPS1 I had felt so alone and forgotten. I felt used, betrayed even. Growing up I knew my friends as a second family. They were always there for me. Though like @CAPS4 kids we fought, but by the end of the day everything was backed to normal. People say, ""@CAPS6 come I never noticed @CAPS6 easy I had @CAPS2 @CAPS1 I was little? I thought I had @CAPS2 bad then?"" @CAPS7 @CAPS2 doesn't matter @CAPS6 the problems change its all the same. @CAPS2 still hurts to fight with friends. You still have days you feel horribly alone, but your not quite sure why. One of those days where the littlest thing seem to cut the deepest. This day was one of those kind of days. Now see, I was young then; I was only in the third grade, and my best friend had been a girl named @PERSON1. I don't remember exactly what we had fought over, but I do remember @CAPS6 if felt.   I remember walking in the classroom, near tears by then. I'd dealt with @PERSON1 being so cruel before, but whatever she had said that day had really hurt me. I was always the first in the classroom, I'm not sure exactly @CAPS6 I was, but I always was. In my seat I sat down and didn't move. My brain had taken me to my own little world of sorrow. That's @CAPS1 she asked me what was wrong. Even as a child I hated @CAPS2 @CAPS1 people I didn't really know asked me if I was okay. @CAPS2 embarrassed me, for @CAPS2 was just another reminder that I was showing weakness to people who probably didn't care. Though this time @CAPS2 was different, and in a weird way @CAPS2 helped. I explained to my teacher what had happened in a rush of tears and details. What really made a difference is that after everything, my teacher tried to comfort me and make me feel better, she made me laugh. Whatever exactly I had told her, her response didn't just make me feel better, but made me realize @CAPS2 wasn't that big of a deal. I giggled for a while to myself, and by the time everyone was in the class I was happy. At the end of the day me and @PERSON1 were back to being best friends. My teacher honestly did me a favor. As a kid your vulnerable. You don't look at the world as a harsh, unforgivable place. That's why people turn out like they do. Its all about the environment they grew up around. I believe I was changed by that small effort. That one little joke made me realize everything's going to get better in the long run. Laughter's been important to me ever since. I helped me realize the effect you have on people. Even at a small age you still can make a difference. Since then I've used what my teacher had taught me. I learned that sometimes, even if you couldn't make them laugh, smile or just be happy; the fact that you tried really made the difference. Laughing is important. @CAPS2 changes people, no matter what the age."	40
21112	" Laughter plays a huge part in my life, my family loves to laugh. We are always making each other and people around us laugh. @CAPS8 you put two or more @CAPS1's together someone is going to start cracking up. Sometimes the kids in my family have games to make each other start @CAPS4.  There is this one @CAPS2 that a couple of us play; no one ever oficaly gave it a name so we just call it theLaughing @CAPS2. The @CAPS2 starts out with one person standing in froung of everone else thats playing. The goal of the @CAPS2 is to try to get one of the other people to start @CAPS4, and the first one to laugh has to trade places with them to do the same thing. We really dont play that often just @CAPS8 their'se nothing else to do. One night my two nefues and I were just siting around looking for something to do @CAPS8 my little nefue @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3 play the @CAPS4 @CAPS2"". His older brother @PERSON1 and I didnt really want to play but there was nothing else to do so we bouth said that we would. It started out like it always did nobody really wanted to go first, but @CAPS7 sombody finly maned up and just went. @CAPS7 it got started. After that everbody was @CAPS4 and having a good time. It went on like this for a while, but after about a houre or so it started to get boaring. @PERSON1 and I were strating to get board out of our minds so we were going to ouit, but my little nefue didnt want us to. @PERSON2 went up to take a turn. @CAPS8 @PERSON2 went up for his turn, he started out like he usually did just making stupid faces and funny sounds to try to get people to laugh. We had seen all of his faces and herd all of his noises so it wasnt going to work. @CAPS7 after he realised that we wernt going to laugh he started telling us a story. He started the story out by saying ""@CAPS6 this guy right; he didnt have anything besides his chair and his box. He loved his chair and his box."" The story wasnt very funny yet but he went with it. ""@CAPS7 the guy went to bed because he was tired and all, and @CAPS8 he woke up his stuff was gone. His chair and his box the only two things that he had in this world were gone. So he went looking for his things. He was searching all day and night but he couldnt find anything not his chair, his box, or even a clue of where they could have gone. So he disides to go to bed and maybe they would be back in the morning like maybe it was all a dream; but @CAPS8 he woke up he had turned into a wild boar."" @CAPS8 he said that @PERSON2 started running around acting like a pig. That got us @CAPS4 but he didnt want to stop there he just kept telling his story. In the story it turnd out that everytime the ""guy"" went to bed something strange would change and it just got more and more funny. My family loves to laugh and have others laugh with us. Just like my nefue @PERSON2 he didnt want to stop telling his story because he had us cracking up. Weather were just hanging out and telling a couple of joaks or making up a @CAPS2 we love to laugh. Lauchter has a huge part in my life."	35
21200	" @CAPS4 whole life, I've been a child of laughter, one who did all @CAPS5 could to find the joy in existence. As I've grown, @CAPS4 hunger for delight hasn't ceased, and when I fell through a metal roof a few years back, @CAPS4 joyous obsession remained. The woman who gave me life is an only child. @CAPS5 has a few step-siblings, but it's a crew we never see. When I think of @CAPS4 relatives, those people never cross @CAPS4 mind. I actually can't even remember them. That fact makes @CAPS4 childhood seem void or vacant (considering that @CAPS4 father died when I was a tiny toddler), but there's no need to feel sympathetic towards me. I mean, sure, growing up in a low-income household, with a single mother and two young children was a hard thing to handle, but I made it through.   Have you ever had a best friend that you considered to be family in some way? That's all that @CAPS4 mother had. Unlike myself, her only savior in life was her closest confidant, @PERSON1. @CAPS5 and @CAPS4 mother had been best friends since before high school - before I was even thought of. @PERSON1's always been there for us. @CAPS5 even stood by @CAPS4 mother's side when I was born. I'm sure as teenagers, having babies was something outlandish, but a mere two years after @CAPS4 arrival, @PERSON1 found herself giving birth to her own beautiful daughter, @PERSON2. They've been @CAPS4 family ever since; @CAPS4 aunt and cousin. For all of @CAPS4 childhood, I grew up in one house. Throughout the years that I resided there, @PERSON1 and her daughter had taken multiple occasions to go on and join us. I used to share a room with @PERSON2, and we fought like rivals, but loved like sisters. @CAPS4 brother was born five years after I and three years after @PERSON2. @CAPS6 was always too small for us to play with, so having other girls in the house was convenient. The both of them served as the family I never had... but it wasn't always such a dandy thing. @PERSON2 and I did a lot of cruel fighting in our time, but I never once thought that maybe our fights would cause them to leave us. One @DATE1 @TIME1, on a warm and bare day, I awoke to find those people of @CAPS4 life missing. They had left. A year or so passed by, and we didn't see them around. @PERSON1 didn't drop by. @CAPS5 didn't send a letter. It was as if they fell off the face of the @LOCATION1. @CAPS4 heart was hurt, but it soon became healed. Our land-line phone began buzzing off the hook one evening, and to our surprise, @PERSON1 was on the other line, ""We just moved in. You have to come see our new place."" @CAPS1, it was as if nothing between the two adults ever went wrong. When we arrived to visit them in their new adobe, @PERSON2 took me to one of her friend's houses to climb their shed. I didn't object, I wanted to be friends again... though if I had known what was in store for me, I wouldn't have gone. As we walked from the crime scene and along the mile road, the most you could hear from our direction was @CAPS4 sobbing. A young boy who didn't seem much older than I turned the corner facing us. When @CAPS6 saw what a mess I was, @CAPS6 laughed. ""@CAPS2 isn't funny!"" I cried. His expression became serious, ""@CAPS3, I... what happened?"" @CAPS4 face was too buried in @CAPS4 hands for me to speak, so @PERSON2 took over, ""@CAPS5 fell through a metal roof!"" The both of us were thinking it, but neither of us said a thing: ""jerk!"" @CAPS6 turned sympathetic and offered a helping hand, but I turned him away. The further @PERSON2 and I paced down the stretch of cement, the more tolerable the wounds on @CAPS4 body became. ""@CAPS7,"" glancing over at @PERSON2, I smiled, ""@CAPS6 was really cute,"" I cradled @CAPS4 face out of embarrassment. @PERSON2 blushed, agreeing with @CAPS4 opinion. ""and it sucks because I'm crying, and dirty, and limping, and a huge bloody mess... and the world just always works @CAPS2 way! Of course I'd run into a cute guy looking like @CAPS2!"" @CAPS4 cousin laughed; @CAPS5 full on cracked up, amused by me. I didn't quite understand it at the time, but something that stirred up in the situation tickled against @CAPS4 inner stomach, and I laughed as @CAPS3. The two of us spent the rest of the distance laughing about the incident and sharing stories similar to our problem. Looking back on all of @CAPS2, I'd like to think that being a young, unintelligent, and naive adolescent brought @CAPS4 cousin and I back to common grounds, but then I'd be lying. In all honesty, it was our laughter. Even in the most scary and tense situations of the world, laughing for any reason makes a person feel better. Laughing heals feelings, arises thoughts, and brings people together."	40
21575	 To me laughter Is someone showing joy and excitement to the others around them. Laughter @MONTH1 some times be used In the wrong kind of way such as @CAPS1 someone where to get hurt In any kind of way the other person laughs at them when @CAPS2 hurt them. When I can make someone else laugh or giggle @CAPS2 not only makes me fill good but also the other person I was talking to. @CAPS2 shows both of us that we can be happy and that there Is joy @CAPS4 of us. I have a friend that I go to school with everyday and he always just looks so grumpy and or upset. And when someone asks him what Is wrong or @CAPS1 he Is okay @CAPS2 seems that he just gets more angry. So me being one of his closer friends I try and help him with that, and so far @CAPS2 has been working and I can make him happy by laughing and getting a big smile on his face. Every time I see him In the hall way or even out of school I will always say something to him to get him to smile and laugh. And by the way I show him I care and him knowing that I don't want him to be grumpy to others we have grew a bond and we seem to spend a lot more time together. And by him being In a better mood @CAPS2 makes his hole day of school lot funner and more enjoyable, and for all the others that are around him. @CAPS1 I were to explain who I was I would say that I am a very happy person and that I have respect for others and I express and show others that. Being happy brings joy to other people that are surrounding you witch usually leads to laughter. Laughter Is a very Important part of your daily life and I think that @CAPS2 brings people closer, so use @CAPS2 don't be afraid.	30
21566	"                                                 Learning to laugh    @DATE1 as we were vacationing in @LOCATION2, I realized that laughter is a big part of our lives, and an important factor that can keep friends and families together. Not too long ago I also discovered that laughter can relieve you from stress, and it even helps you lose weight, which, I thought was pretty interesting. My sister on the other hand still did not quite believe that laughter could do all of that. She thought it was just being blown out of proportion. She believed that if her friends didn't want to hang around with her, then there was something wrong with them, that if we didn't have enough food in the house, it was probably my parents fault. There was always some one to blame for whatever happened to her, there was always a bad side to everything. But that @DATE1 it was going to be different she was about to find out that she didn't have to live her live that way, because there is always an alternative.     The trip to @LOCATION2 was something everyone was expecting, even me. I was actually really excited to see my cousins and the rest of the family. Everybody packed their things, we got ready to leave, got on the car and left to the air port. My aunt @CAPS1 was already waiting for us at the @LOCATION2 city airport. Everything was going great. So far... When we got there, my aunt drove all of us to our little town in the state of @LOCATION1, just about an hour and a half away from the airport. As we were getting there I noticed my sister had a strange look on her face, she seemed somehow confused, lost in her own thoughts as if she was worried about something.""@CAPS2's wrong with you, are you okay? you look all weird..."" I said sounding a little sarcastic and hoping to start a conversation.""@CAPS3 face is all weird!""she said and that was the @DATE1 thing she said to me until we reached our destination.  As we got to our grandparents house we begun to see all our family members already waiting for us outside. The joy of seeing them there was incredible. I looked around around and i saw my sister, I was glad that she looked happy, i thought she was actually enjoying the moment. I did not know @CAPS2 was wrong with her and her sudden attitude changes until we got to the little playground my grandma has in the backyard. During my time there I met new family members, saw some old familiar faces and remembered some good and also bad memories, memories which I thought had vanished from my mind already. Turns out they were still there, all the way at the back of my head were I had tried to hide them so that they would never come up again, but somehow they managed to get out and make their way into my thoughts again, and that is when I started to feel like a monster once again. Suddenly I had a flash back to the time when we came to visit, a couple of years ago. That's when it all came to me i saw the whole scene once again I felt horrible. There she was, my little sister @PERSON1 playing in the swings, suddenly she let go of the swing and she felt right into a mud puddle that was there. Every body laughed, I laughed. I thought it was funny, but she didn't laugh, she didn't cry either, she just got up and ran inside.  I never stopped to ask her if she was okay, I didn't realize how my actions had affected her. It was all my fault, I knew she was really sensitive when it came down to some specific situations, but I did not help her, I didn't give her the comfort and support she needed from her big sister, so she never learned to laugh at herself and keep going. That would have been a nice advice to give her instead of laughing at her. Then, after a couple of minutes of reflection about it, I went up to her and apologized, she looked a little confused at first, but then she realized where i was going. This made the rest of the trip a lot more easier, now that I knew @CAPS2 was wrong, we both tried our best to fix the problem and work on her self esteem.  Laughter was the perfect therapy for her. All she needed to do was to learn how to laugh about her self when things did not go the way she wanted them. It was hard but we accomplished our goal. My sister discovered the power of laughter, and she learned to get back up from her mistakes. Life taught both of us an important lesson that @DATE1. I'm sure that was one of the most exciting trips we've ever taken and the memories from that trip will stay with us forever."	37
20977	" ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" @CAPS3 quote can be agreed by everyone on @LOCATION1. Everyone loves to laugh and have a good time. Especially @CAPS1 with a person you care about. @CAPS1 is something you and another person can do together with ease. @CAPS3 brings two people closer together and brightens a person's life. Some people, like me, are always looking for a guy who knows how to make me smile and laugh. I need to know that arguing isn't going to be the main part of @CAPS3 relationship. Having someone who makes you laugh is a key factor in life. At the age of sixteen I had my first boyfriend. I was the girl who kept on rejecting guys and telling them I was trying to wait for that perfect guy. In the @DATE2 I met @ORGANIZATION2. Even though he was older than me and we might be opposites, he always knows how to make me smile. My first impression of him was his cute smile. After getting to know him and talking on the phone a couple of times I realized that I started to have feelings for @CAPS3 boy. Whenever we talked he always had me @CAPS1. I found @CAPS3 very attractive. Having someone who brings some sunshine into my life made me feel like I was on top of the world. On @DATE1 there was a football game, @ORGANIZATION1 (two schools who are rivals). During @CAPS3 time him and I still weren't dating. That day I invited him to come over so we could watch the game together. I had previously told him how I love stuffed animals. That day he showed up with a fluffy stuffed animal. We were walking around the track, @CAPS2 all of a sudden I tripped. My first reaction was to use my nervous laugh. He had his arm around me and whispered in my ear ""I would never let you @DATE3."" I turned cherry red. From that day on he will remember me as the clumpsy girl who trips all the time. Now that i look back at the day I realize how funny that memory was. Looking back at embarrassing moments is always a good thing in a relationship.  @CAPS2 you are looking for someone who you want to spend the rest of your life together you have to make sure you like them for whom they are. You don't want them to change. The goal is to be able to spend time with someone who you can have a good time with and crack some jokes around. I always tell my friends ""@CAPS1 is a great ab workout."" Which is true because whenever I laugh, my abs are always sore the next day. Being able to have a good time with friends, and laugh about random stuff is always something I look forward to. If there is no @CAPS1 going on, then that means I'm not having a good time. But lucky me, I have amazing friends who make jokes about everything. Whenever I'm around them there is never a moment @CAPS2 I'm not @CAPS1. Being able to make others laugh is a great characteristic in a person.  @CAPS2 you meet a new person, would you rather have awkward silence? Or do you prefer someone who will make you laugh? I'm hoping we have the same answer, because I hate awkward silence. I need to know that @CAPS3 person will make me laugh and smile and not make me be thinking ""@CAPS2 will I be able to leave?"" @CAPS3 is one of the worst situations anyone would want to go through, I can say @CAPS3 from personal experience. Even though I'm not the best at saying jokes, I use all my embarrassing moments and thats my way I have people @CAPS1. I don't get mad about it, I'm the total opposite. I laugh along with them. I know I'm clumpsy, I know I have my moments, and if these things can bring a smile to a persons face, then I'm @PERCENT1 fine with it. My goal is to be able to make people smile @CAPS2 they are down. So instead of cracking a joke, I just remind them of an embarrassing thing that has happened to me. Everyone is unique in their own ways. That's what makes everyone special. Different people have different ways of making others laugh. And once a guy gets a girl to laugh, that's the first sign @CAPS3 guy was meant for them. Having someone who can make you smile is a key factor in life. @CAPS1 means that you are having a good time. @CAPS1 brings people together. @CAPS1 can brighten a persons life. So next time you meet someone, maybe a joke here and there will help you break the ice."	42
21249	 It was the first day of the ninth grade, that terrifying day when one must choose how they are to be percieved for the next four years. I walked into my first class looking like a hippie on steroids, just over six feet tall and nearly two hundred and sixty pounds of long haired, freckled teenager. I was a giant, and that made it difficult for bullies to muster up the machismo to treat me as the freshman that I was. I sat down in my designated seat, next to one of the girls I could tell thought too highly of herself. Despite this off putting first impression, I atteampted friendship. My atteampt was met with confusion and disgust.  As I turned to face the front of the class once more, there stood the teacher. @PERSON1 announced that our first assignment was to create a presentation, one that would show the rest of the class who we are. I was excited at the prospect of a presentation. I have always been a showman, and the limelight is a very dear friend. I love to act, sing, and in general entertain. My crown jewel however, is humor. I have found that I can captivate an audience no matter the number, with humor. With this I designed a presentation to entrap and engage my class in the reality of who, and what I am. I wrote a speech in which I explained my talents and the many things I enjoy. In this speech were many twists and turns of phrase, punchlines and puns. There was such laughter that other teachers came to see what was causing the noise.  I took a bow and sat in my seat, looking around at the shining faces of my new friends. I knew then and there that laughter would be the tool with which i would build my highschool life. I could make someone forget about their troubles for a spell, or brighten someones day with a few words. I wasn't a star athlete. I wasn't even a star pupil. But I seemed to collect friends like I was made of fly paper. There is no better feeling i have yet felt, that compares to the company of friends. As long as i have humor, I shall never be without that feeling.	42
21465	" Laugh @CAPS1 @CAPS2                         @CAPS3 @CAPS4 someone who laughs a lot or a little? If @CAPS4 @CAPS3 the kind of person that can laugh about any and everything, then I'm sure we would get along well. Laughter plays a key part in my life. @CAPS1 is a part in about three different ways, in that I joke around a lot about numerous things, I do funny things such as make funny faces, and last I also laugh about me being a klutz. When @CAPS4 see me or talk to me for either a short amount of time or an abundant amount of time I guarantee I can and will make @CAPS4 laugh. Laughter can be an amazing thing, when in any kind of situation as in an awkward one, an embarrassing time, or just any kind of situation when @CAPS4 don't know what @CAPS4 should do; just remember @CAPS4 can laugh in those times. Ever since I was just a young girl no matter where or what I was doing I always seemed to be a huge klutz. My mom would always say, "" @CAPS4 @CAPS3 worse then a bull in a @LOCATION1 shop."" @CAPS5 was so right. If @CAPS1 was just as simple as me dropping things, maybe even breaking glass, or falling; that statement was always true. All @CAPS5 could ever do when I did do something like that was just laugh, because @CAPS5 knew that @CAPS5 has a clumsy daughter.  Such as this one time when I was in elementary school, we had award assemblies every month, these were to recognize students who had been doing well that month and was following the rules of a certain characteristic. This was the day I had hoped for; my name to get called. When the teachers were up on the stage calling names, I was anticipating for @CAPS1 to be my turn. Then next up my name was called. I got up and was so excited and nervous to go in front of the crowd and get my award. When I had gotten up there I got my award then went back down the stairs. Not a great idea when I was so excited. When I was going down, I literally went down the stairs. My feet had missed a stair, and I went flying down on my behind. Now tell me what would @CAPS4 do in this situation? In front of over two-hundred kids and about thirty parents? Well I just had to laugh @CAPS1 @CAPS2, get up, and go back to my seat. Another thing about laughter @CAPS1 really makes me who I am to this day. I don't know where or what I would be doing if @CAPS1 weren't for me lacking dexterity when I was younger. Laughter has brought me closer to my family and friends. They know when I am looking gloomy; that if they want me to not look so gloomy that they will have to make me laugh. My closest friends and I joke around and laugh about numerous things. Sometimes @CAPS1 might be facetious, so we have to catch ourselves on those ones. From my experience of being clumsy no matter the situation, I learned that instead of being embarrassed and not wanting to bring up what happened ever again, that making @CAPS1 funny, and something @CAPS4 can laugh about is much better. Learning from a young age to laugh and have fun, @CAPS1 really has made me a better person; in that people know me me for many different things, but one of them is that I am a happy and funny girl and laugh a lot.That is something that I am proud of, just knowing that I can make my peers and other adults laugh and have good time. So therefore laughter is not just one element or part in my life, @CAPS1 plays a huge part."	36
20823	" Laughter is like cooking; it brings people of every kind together, but the wrong food or the wrong time can bring discomfort to you and others around you, such as beans. Laughter is a medicine. Laughter is a universal language; you can speak @CAPS2 ""language"" with a foreign friend, even when you know not an ounce of their native tongue. Laughter differs, ranging in loudness, pattern, softness, and attitude. You laughed weeks into @CAPS2 world and you'll be laughing your way out of it as well. Sometimes in life, it is important to laugh! Laughter is forgiving and a nod to acceptance. It was my freshman year and I had arrived early that morning to keep my friend company who's mom had dropped her off at such an early time, due to transportation conflicts. I wasn't sure why we were even fighting or why we were on @CAPS2 particular subject; I only knew we had gone off on a ""bunny trail"" and @CAPS4 was picking me apart for something I had done weeks ago. Our voices were escalating and despite the fact our disagreement wasn't taking a turn toward the physical, our words were just as devastating, taking jabs below the belt and giving ""black eyes"" of sorts to both teams. @CAPS4 was right and I knew it, but did @CAPS4 really have to carry such an air of self-righteousness? I thought, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS4 hadn't done what @CAPS4 did, I wouldn't have any secrets to spill."" @CAPS2 was also wrong of me, but my attention wasn't focusing on that, but rather on deflecting her fiery words, sure to not let my guard down and start crying or something ridiculous like that.  ""That only happenedone time!""@CAPS4 declared as @CAPS4 tried to defended herself. ""@CAPS3 way, you didn't have to tell the whole world!"" ""I didn't tell the world,"" I objected. ""I only told one person...who told one person, who told another person...and so on.""@CAPS4 raised her eyebrow in a manner as @CAPS1 to say, ""@CAPS5? You @CAPS6 know what I'm talking about."" The air in the room was as stiff as our direction we were taking in our argument, going no where and getting to no point. The feeling was mutual; @CAPS4 was done with me, I was done with her. @CAPS4 leaned back casually against the wall, attempting to appear apathetic, when her ankle succumbed to gravity and the present moisture, grazing the surface and causing her to loose her footing. All the cool @CAPS4 once had was thrown out the window. Her shoe caught the slick surface of the tile, wet from where hundreds of trodden footsteps were left from that morning's downpour. Crashing down, @CAPS4 met the unforgiving, stone floor with a @CAPS7! which left her face dazed and pride altered. I wish that was how the conversation had gone--with her standing not three feet tall and me towering above her. Concealing the slight satisfaction that was lurking behind my dimples, I slowly slid down the wall that stood behind me, coming to eye level with her. I took one look into her eyes, as @CAPS1 they were waving a white flag and then the smug victory left me. I craned my neck backward, smiled at the ceiling and let out a giggle. I'm not sure what @CAPS4 thought about that at first yet slowly but surely, @CAPS4 managed a chuckle. My giggle triggered into a full-out laughter seizure, her catching on and soon leaving us both laying on the floor. There was nothing particularly special about that bleak, speckled tile, but it was that desolate stone we ended up sprawled on, heads huddled on and hands on our bellies, trying to steady our breaths back into normalcy that one early morning. Sure, I apologized and @CAPS4 accepted, but I think her forgiveness went without saying; laughter is not dependent on words. ""@CAPS8,"" @CAPS4 managed with a smile. The laughter my friend and I had shared in that pre-school classroom carried throughout the day.  ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" That very distance brought assurance into the relationship I shared with my friend. No, it didn't solve our problems, but it reminded us of how silly and meaningless our petty arguments amounted to be, definitely something worth laughing at. Sure, her fall from grace triggered the expression of innocent surrender from my part, laughter, but it was the letting go of bitterness and the welcoming of a laugh from both sides that ended it all. So, no, while we were not on the same brave wave, our laughter was above picking sides--we were still speaking the same ""language."""	41
20817	"          There are times I get along with others and times I don't. There also are times where I make others laugh until they cry. Like this one time me and my friends where walking to the store, I start pointing out the most random things. When I pointed out the @CAPS1 store, he started laughing so hard that he literally peed his pants. So we had to go back to his house so he could change into some clean cloth, and it took him @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes to get dressed. So I asked @CAPS6 he was doing in there, and he said. ""I'm taking a pee."" @CAPS2 I started laughing and rolling on the floor, and that's when it hit me why he was laughing so hard about me pointing out the @CAPS1 store. It was because the last time we had gone inside and there was a man talking about his son's football team which my friend and I was on at the time, was in the top ten. Guss @CAPS6 we really weren't. The man felt so afraid of @CAPS6 the lady he was talking to might think of him. So @CAPS5 gets up and says to us. ""@CAPS4 you for letting me know that. I thought he was right for a second."" @CAPS5 gives us a hug and the man gets up and says. ""@CAPS6 about me? How come I don't get a hug."" That when I started to laugh harder @CAPS2 heck. Good thing I did not have to go to the rest room. "	30
20979	" My mom always say laughter is the greatist medican and it is true for me anyways. When ever I got sick or hurt I will allways laugh at a great joke and it made me feel a little better when ever my family go on a long trip we always made jokes and tease each other soon the trip dont seem that long at all. it's very short and you wish that it could of been longer. One night me and my family was going home from the store and my brother asked ""what are we having for dinner tonight"" ""hambugers"" she told us my brother kind of freaked out becouse we dont got @ORGANIZATION1's and my mom said all well and my dad then was in a smal store called @CAPS1 hopped in the car and started to drive home. ""I feel like having mexican food tonight can we eat at @ORGANIZATION2's tonight"" my mom asked ""no I thought we were having hambugers tonight"" he answered ""We have no @ORGANIZATION1's"" my mom laughed. Then my dad stopped the car and turned around ""why"" we all asked ""we don't got @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS2 has some chips at least"" then we all started bursting out laughing. Once we got ot the place and found a place to sit we were all talking and my sister bursted out "" look dad I can move the straw from just looking at it"" and she stared at the straw in the cup and everyone whent silent. I knew that it wouldn't move so I tapped the straw so it can move ""ha look it moved"" she was laughing knowing that she did not move the straw. my mom was trying to hold the laugh becouse my dad for a second thought she could move the straw for just looking at it. ""I can't believe I fell for that"" we finished up are meal and went home laughing and joking all the way.   Laughter can bring people together family, friends, even enymeys sometimes I laugh so hard that I could not breath so well. laughter bring fun in life and knowing that some other people have the same intrests and you @MONTH1 gain a friend you never know just like my family and the @LOCATION1's trip everyone laughs. When it snowed one day I graved my cell phone and gathered the neighbors and my brother and sister and went to the park together we had this idea to have a snow ball fight mixed with capture the flag. We all picked our bases and the type of flag that we want and then started the game we had fun playing we were laughing so hard that it hurt and soon before I relized it I was geting to know my nieghbor better after that day we talked to each other more and understood each other more the next time we have a snow ball fight I hope she is on my team and we will win for sure."	31
21068	  Sence I was a little girl I' ve lived without my bio mom, @CAPS1 gave me up for adaption when @CAPS1 was only @NUM1, @CAPS1 wasn't ready @CAPS8 be a mom. @CAPS1 has always been a risk taker an never thought about her concequences. My adoptive parents have always been truthful @CAPS4 me about her an why @CAPS1 gave me up. I accept how my life has turned out an im very grateful, @CAPS2 i wasn't adopted i wouldnt have gotton @CAPS8 know my @PERSON1, The most loving, adventurous, funny, wise women you would ever meet. As soon as i could walk @PERSON1 would have me out camping and hiking @CAPS4 her. @CAPS2 @CAPS6 was a nice sunny day no one would have any doubt were we would be. @CAPS2 we were at @PERSON1's house in the @DATE1 or @DATE2 we would always be out in her garden boy how @PERSON1 @CAPS3 her gardens and flowers. No wait thats a lie @PERSON1 @CAPS3 nature period.  @CAPS1 has taught me how @CAPS8 appreciate everything around me exspecially nature, @CAPS4 me an her we are closer then anything you could think of, @CAPS2 shes the sky im her stars, @CAPS2 i' m a bird @CAPS1's my wings. @CAPS6's that simply. @CAPS6 hasn't always been easy for her an me, but the way we know how @CAPS8 cope is @CAPS8 laugh at everything an everyone, not in a bully or make fun of kind a way, but a good way. Laughin for me an my @PERSON1 comes like a second nature @CAPS8 us, @CAPS6's what keeps us going an know that everything will be okay. A few months ago my favorite cousin @CAPS7 had passed away, @PERSON1 and I had barley seen each other in a while or had talked, but then everything happend so fast @CAPS4 @PERSON2. That when we saw each other @CAPS6 was at his funeral. My sizemore family was all there, even tho @PERSON2 was gone he had a presence that was still there. That night after the funeral everyone went @CAPS8 my aunties house an just spent time together. Finally @PERSON1 and I got the chance @CAPS8 talk yes we were both teary eyed but we were laughing @CAPS8.We were laughin at all the funny times we had @CAPS4 @PERSON2 an all the crazy things he did. One time he had went @CAPS8 go get my uncle from the airport an he was waiting there in his elvis costum holding a sizemore sign..Boy was @PERSON2 a goof.  @PERSON1 was just telling me all these things, and @CAPS6 was then that i relized @PERSON1 had tought me something else @CAPS8 appreciate. @PERSON1 had taught me how @CAPS8 appreciate laughter at a time @CAPS4 sorrow. @CAPS8 rejoice in a time of dealth, @CAPS8 have hope when you felt like you had none left. I learned that even tho people might not think so, laughter is the key medicine @CAPS8 everyones pain. People don't think of laughter as a cure they think of @CAPS6 as something you do after you hear a joke. Laughter is so much more then people give @CAPS6 credit for. My @PERSON1 taught me all those things, plus the real meaning of laughter, and that will always be @CAPS4 me.	36
21071	" One day, a day before the party for my brother's @DATE1 to be exact. We were setting up party stuff and cleaning the house and the apartment because that's were the boy's will be hanging out and sleeping. My cousin @PERSON4 and I were helping mom and the boy's that were already here and their names would be @PERSON5 , @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. @PERSON6 was already here of course because he's the @DATE1 boy. The boy's were suppose to be cleaning the apartment but their boy's and the only things on theirs minds are girls and video games. They played video games instead of cleaning and mom got mad. Lucky for them mom was in a very good mood or they would have got @CAPS7. The last to boy's showed up now.   The last two boy's showed up and their names are @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 is showing up tomorrow after noon. @PERSON6 was so exited that he was turning @NUM1 years old , he said "" I'm @NUM1 years old now no one can tell me what to do"" and I laughed and said ""@PERSON6 go make me a sandwich"" and he said ""@CAPS3"" and I said ""so much for no one can tell me what to do"" and everyone laughed at him. He gave me my sandwich and all the boy's went to the apartment to clean @CAPS7 but when I got in there they set up @PERSON5's x-box @NUM3 and was playing @CAPS7. I told them to get cleaning but they decided not to listen so I got mom and they sure listened to her. She took @CAPS7 and put @CAPS7 on the kitchen table. They were not happy. They finally cleaned the apartment and got the x-bow back. @TIME1 all of us were watching movies and playing broad games then mom told @PERSON4 and I to clean my room , maybe a hour after that she walked by and said "" bed time"" and boy's go to the apartment. The next mourning.  The next mourning @PERSON4 and I woke up to the sun hitting us in the eyes and I said ""what a great way to start off the day"" and @PERSON4 said ""I know"". The best part of today is that we get to hang out with the boy's. When @PERSON4 and I got into the living room everybody was in the kitchen and partly in the living room. @TIME1 that @TIME1 the boy's thought @CAPS7 would be fun if they played cops and rubbers. The apartment was the jail. @PERSON2 , @CAPS2 , @PERSON6 were the cops and @PERSON5 and @CAPS1 were the rubbers. @PERSON4 and I wanted to play so we went outside and ran into @PERSON5 on the otter side of the apartment , he was the only one who knew we were outside. When I was running to hide behind the trees I felling in the hole that turns off the water for the apartment and my leg looked like cottage cheese and @CAPS7 was gushing blood and you could see my bone. I had to stop playing for the @TIME1. Mom told @PERSON4 and I to go to bed.  The next mourning mom woke us up and asked if we want eggs and bacon and we said ""yes"". I crawled out of bed because I needed to go to the bathroom so @PERSON4 helped me up the stairs and when we were coming down the stairs @PERSON5 saw me hurting and being the amazing boyfriend he is he picked me up and carried me to the couch in the living room and sat me down on the couch and kissed the top of my head and said ""good mourning beautiful"" and I said ""good mourning to you to baby"". Now everybody is standing around for their food to be done. The boy's are making pizza if you wanted to know. Then my little sister @CAPS6 walked in to the kitchen and said ""ma'am I want a cookie"" and mom said "" okay , here you go baby"". @CAPS6 ran off with a very big smile on her face. The boy's got their pizza now and they just went back to the apartment. @PERSON4 and I looked at mom and said ""wow"" mom's like i know. We all laughed and started talking about boy's and friends , family , animals. @CAPS7 was a very fun weekend and even though I got hurt we still made the best of @CAPS7. Even though I got hurt and cant do anything for the next two months or so , we still had a blast with each other and @PERSON6 said "" @CAPS7 was his most favorite @DATE1 he's ever had so far . @CAPS6 wanted her friend to come over but she had fun with mom and @PERSON4 , the boy's when they came in the house and I. Sometimes you got to work with what you got and @CAPS7 might turn out more fun than your normal plan you made. Just make sure your happy with the people around you. "	30
21399	"                                                  Laughter  Laughter, how do you define it? The non-existence of happiness? Without laughter, @CAPS1 would be no smiles. Without smiles, @CAPS1 would be no affection. Without affection @CAPS1 would be no emotion. Without emotion, @CAPS1 would be no re-action. Without a re-action, everyone around you would be blank. Laughter; it can do so many things. It can bring people together or even tear people apart. It can be a way @CAPS2 express yourself, or even a way @CAPS2 put up ""your walls."" Laughter could mean so many different things. It can show so many different different things. It can show so many emotions, or even hide them. For example: @CAPS1's those people who laugh when they cry, when @CAPS1 mad, when @CAPS1 sad ect. But look beyond the picture why do you think @CAPS1 laughing at these times? When really that's not at all the emotion they are feeling. @CAPS1 not laughing because @CAPS1 all around a happy person. @CAPS1 laughing @CAPS2 hide the true pain they are feeling inside, because whether they like it or not no human can completely let ""it all on the line."" @CAPS2 be so vulnerable anyone could get in and cause pain. So how important is laughter @CAPS2 you? In and kind of relationship laughter is important. W heather it be a friendship, a marriage, an engagement ect. @CAPS2 know how your partner is feeling can make all the difference. So one laugh or giggle could make turn it all around. Laughter it's the shortest distance between two people."	25
20758	" I never thought that laughing can help you start a conversation with someone you don't even know. But @CAPS4 can. Just by laughing with someone can get you to meet a new person. One of the things I do first @CAPS6 someone is trying to be funny is laugh. Once you know @CAPS2 the other person is talking about, you forget that you are just getting to know that person. This happened to me once. @CAPS4 happened in @LOCATION1, where my family and I usually go every year in @DATE1. I made a great friend and the first thing we did was laugh. As you know, @LOCATION1 is a hot place and the sun is usually out every day. I spend the days we stay over there going out to walk with my sister and cousins or going to the beach with all my family. I remember @CAPS4 was a day that my cousins, sister and I went to a small store that's right down the street from where we stay at. We wanted to buy candy and other stuff to bring with us @CAPS6 we returned to our home. I didn't expect to see one of my cousins there with his friends. @CAPS6 I saw them, the only thing they were doing was laughing about something. I couldn't hear them but once we got closer, I heard a hilarious thing they said. I couldn't help overhearing so I started to laugh. One of his friends saw me laughing and he thought I was laughing at him. He asked me if I was laughing at him and of course I said no. I told him I had accidentally overheard his conversation so then he started to laugh. ""That was funny wasn't @CAPS4"" he told me laughing. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS4 was. I didn't know you made jokes like that"" I replied.  He kept on talking to me and then he said, ""I always talk like that so don't be afraid. I don't say @CAPS4 to hurt anyone.""  I thought @CAPS4 was nice for him to clear that out but I already knew people in @LOCATION1 talk like that. We kept on talking @CAPS6 I started to laugh again. ""@CAPS2 did I say now?"" he asked. ""@CAPS3. I was just remembering @CAPS2 you said in the beginning. That was really funny"" I replied. For some reason I couldn't forget of @CAPS2 he said and I don't think I will ever forget. I think @CAPS4 was probably because the way we met was really surprising to me. I had never met a person, especially a guy, by laughing first. I guess I thought @CAPS4 was a great way to start a conversation. Laughing with the person will let them know that we are interested in their subject and we understand them. That's at least @CAPS2 I thought. I had a good conversation with my new friend. We talked about how I was taking my vacations. I told him that every year I go and I always enjoy them. My family and I have a great time spending time with my grandparent and cousins from @LOCATION1. I told him I sometimes say I would rather live in @LOCATION1 than where I live know because @CAPS4's so much calmer there. He agreed with me on one part of @CAPS2 I had told him because he knows @CAPS2 @CAPS4's like to live in @LOCATION1, but he doesn't know how I's like to live in any other place. After he told me that, he stayed quiet for a couple of seconds. I noticed something instantly. I had noticed that our conversation wasn't like in the beginning. In the beginning, we wouldn't stop laughing and we had interesting stuff to say. Then, @CAPS4 got calmer and a little unusual. I didn't want to just stop our conversation there so I asked him where was he going to go because @CAPS6 I started talking to him, he was with one of my cousins and I was with my other cousins. Now we started laughing again. This time @CAPS4 was because we just had noticed that the people we were with had left us. ""@CAPS6 did they leave?"" he asked me. ""I don't know, but they can't be that far because we haven't been talking for a long time,"" I told him. We walked together to go and look for them and I was right. They weren't that far. They were still looking for things to buy and I don't think they noticed we were missing. We just got together with them and acted as if @CAPS3 had happened. @CAPS4 was strange for me because whenever I looked at him, I would remember our conversation. The first thing that would come to my mind was that we started our conversation by laughing at a funny thing he said. I actually liked making a new friend this way. Now, whenever I go to @LOCATION1, I know I have a new friend over there and if I decide to, I can make other friends by simply laughing with them in their conversations."	40
20982	 One day my friends and I went to a friends house and we started playing @CAPS1 box we were laughing having an awesome time. My friend @CAPS2 started telling jokes and all my friends started laughing hysterically. My friend @CAPS3 was drinking milk at that time and @CAPS5 laughed so hard that milk started coming out of his nose, that was also funny but gross at the same time. @CAPS6 was the sad one of the whole group that was there, we all asked him, @CAPS4 was @CAPS5 so sad @CAPS5 answered that @CAPS5 heard that his girlfriend wanted to break up with him. So @CAPS5 asked us how to keep her interested, and we said that @CAPS5 should tell her some jokes to make her laugh. @CAPS5 said that @CAPS5 would think about it @CAPS6 was a real funny person and a blast to hang out with, so we didn't really worry about it so much, we thought that everything would be fine. So after all that @CAPS5 left and we started hanging out in my friend, @CAPS7's living room. We were hanging out and just talking about who was the hottest girl at school. So an hour past and my friend @CAPS6 came back. @CAPS5 came and sat with us and yelled I didn't work man, I was like okay calm down, @CAPS9 happened I asked?. @CAPS5 said, she didn't think it was funny she thought that I was being dumb and just plain silly. Oh did she really say silly that's not I word i thought she knew, everyone laughed, no @CAPS6 I was just messing with you man don't get mad come on now. So @CAPS6 left after @CAPS5 yelled at me, @CAPS5 left and all of us guys started laughing I thought that @CAPS5 was just but hurt and @CAPS5 would get over it. an hour past and my phone starts ringing and I look who's calling and it @CAPS6 s ex girlfriend. Surprised I answer and I tell her that @CAPS6 wasn't with us that I would tell him to call you later, I said that because @CAPS5 would use my phone to talk to her, but then she replied that she wanted to talk to me so I was like okay so we started talking and she is telling me that she likes me... I start cracking up in laughter. She got all sad and mad at me because of me laughing. But I told that it was cool that she did so I told her I have to go and we hanged up... I couldn't help my self i started cracking up again and so that's how my day ended in laughter and it was like that all day                                       	32
21093	" Many people think that @ORGANIZATION1 is just like any other. These people are very wrong. @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 is very different than most. For you see, it is filled with humorous people. These people make up a lot of the bright side of @ORGANIZATION1. Where these people are you might ask? Why, they are every where. The best place to look is in the hallways, especially @DATE1 @ORGANIZATION1, during lunch, @CAPS2 after @ORGANIZATION1. Most of the people I will tell you about are friends of mine. There are also a lot of people I don't even know the names of. There is even a teacher I'll mention something about. Well enough chit chat, lets get to it shall we? I will first start with the teacher. I forget her name but she likes to talk with a @CAPS1 accent. She is also very enthusiastic, @CAPS2 I do mean enthusiastic. She often says, ""@CAPS3 we go!"". It's very funny. I have never seen her without enthusiasm. Many of the students are really disturbed by it. It can be annoying at times but at least she's not all gloomy or other. In fact we might even need more like her at this @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 many others. There is also a student who is also very enthusiastic, not all the time but quite often is he. His name is @CAPS4. @CAPS4 is quite a jolly kid. He loves to sing. I do mean he loves to sing. Even if he doesn't know the words to the song he is singing, he will sing. People always joke about him around him. The jokes are usually mean jokes, but he puts up with them @CAPS2 laughs along. I really do have to give him that much credit. It would be hard for just about anyone to put up with such rude words, let alone laugh with them. But enough of that. He is very jolly @CAPS2 really makes you laugh, which is really great. Don't stop being funny @CAPS4. There is a funny pair of boys who can knock your shoes @CAPS3, perhaps even literally with what they do. These two boys, named @PERSON3 @CAPS2 @PERSON1, are very humorous, as well as dangerously humorous. Ever heard of a @CAPS6? It is a brand of a toy that is very fun for little kids, as well as big kids. This toy is shaped like a bowl. You turn it inside out, aim the rim at the ground, @CAPS2 drop it. When it hits the ground, it pops up into the air. Well, @PERSON3 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 love playing with the @CAPS6, so much to the point that they found a new way to play with it. Instead of hitting the ground with it, they hit each other with it! They love to hurt each other. Eventually, though, the @CAPS6 got very worn out @CAPS2 tore. It needed to retire from its rough job, but @PERSON3 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 wouldn't let it. They just couldn't stop playing with it. @PERSON2, @CAPS9, @CAPS2 I haven't seen them playing with it lately. We think it might have broke. Ha ha! Never go wondering throught the hallways with @PERSON2, even if you have a destination. Trust me on this, you don't want to! @PERSON2 gets destracted very easily in the hallways. If she sees someone that she's wants to talk to, she doesn't tell you. She just twirls around @CAPS2 rushes over to them. For this, always have her take the lead if you do go with her; at least you'd know when she wonders @CAPS3 the trail. Never the less, @PERSON2 is still very humorous. She makes lots of random sounds. You get completely @CAPS3 guard @CAPS2 just can't help to laugh at how weird sounding those sounds are. @CAPS9 on the other hand, not only does sounds but also does hilarious facial expressions. She always tries to mimic the funny things her goats @CAPS2 pets do when she tells us about them. Together, @CAPS9 @CAPS2 I are very funny. In the @DATE1 finals started, we were drawing such goofy pictures of each other @CAPS2 random things. I drew her as a stick figure going to the moon, but the moon was very far away. We cracked up! She once redrew a little comic her brother thought of more than a year or two again. In the comic, it was a very ugly man who was telling his friends that they were going to a night club, but the ugly man turned out to be a woman. During finals, there was also a guy pulling is friend through the hallways by the arm. The friend said that it was very comfy. Then, they told a teacher about it! Ha ha ha! So you see, @LOCATION1 is much more than an ordinary @ORGANIZATION1. You could probably call it a clown @ORGANIZATION1 if you wanted to. Ha ha ha ha! You would never truly know just how many ha ha's I say a day until you visit, so come on over. We will let you join the fun!"	42
21334	 My father is a stone cold mean man. About the only time he smiles is when hes has a beer or when hes with friends. Last @DATE1 we where at my grandparent's house for a family barbecue when we got a call from mt @CAPS3 cousin @PERSON1 she told us that my @CAPS1 was in my great aunts will, a few days earlier we had gotten a call saying that great aunt @PERSON2 had died. My grandpa thought he was going to be in the will but he wasn't. Two weeks latter my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and me went to @LOCATION2 for my great aunts funeral. When we got to @LOCATION2 we drove to the upper peninsula. It turns out that we where going to a island on lake @LOCATION3 called @LOCATION1 island. Then when we got to my @CAPS3 cousin @PERSON1's house she toke us through the will. My @CAPS1 got @NUM1 acres, @NUM2 acres of forest, @NUM3 acres meadow, and @NUM3 acres with a two bedroom house, barn, and smoke shed.       	30
21222	 laughter is the best medicine,well that is what some people say. I think that laughter is good for you and if you are in a relationship laughing is really good for that. @CAPS1 here are some of the ways laughing is good for you. laughing in a relationship is good because if you can't laugh together you probably not be together. If you can't laugh with your boyfriend/girlfriend you will not have a very good relationship with him/her. @CAPS1 don't be scared to laugh a little with your boyfriend or girlfriend. I think and I think most people will say the same thing to that if you want a good relationship you need to laugh.laughing is good when you are sad because you can get told a joke and if it is a good joke it can make you feel better.It works at school to you laugh with your friends and all your stress will go away.if we all just laugh about more things and not take things @CAPS1 sonorously we would not have @CAPS1 many bad stuff happen in the world. we will all get along better and not get in fights in school,wouldn't have @CAPS1 many people in jail or person,   @CAPS1 that is why i think laughter is the best medicine for people who are sad,stress,and in relationship. But you think what you want but this is what i think is good about laughing.	27
21630	"                               Trippin' on fences I am @NUM1 years young, and in those short @NUM1 years, all I can ever remember, is laughing hysterically. Whether it was about something stupid I did, or my best friend doing something stupid, or most of the time when we got together and did something outrageous. Someone once said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"". With my best friend @ORGANIZATION2 and I, that's exactly the case. I always get a good ab workout whenever I'm with her, because I'm always bursting with laughter. It was my @NUM3 grade year at @ORGANIZATION1 here in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION3. I was hanging out with my best friend @ORGANIZATION2 during our lunch break outside. I was showing her my new jeans I'd just gotten the day before, at @LOCATION2. I was also telling her about a note that had been passed to me, by a boy who had apparently had a crush on me for sometime, this boy had also asked me out on the note. @ORGANIZATION2 had asked me if she could see it, when I handed it over to her, all of a sudden, she chucked the note over the fence. Clearly, the guy didn't have @ORGANIZATION2's approval. I couldn't just leave the guy hanging without an answer, especially when at the time, I liked him back. I begged @ORGANIZATION2 to give me my note back, but she refused. What was I supposed to do, just let an unanswered note lay on the other side of the fence? No. The only solution was to hop over the fence and grab it. So I, in my new jeans might I add, practically straddled the fence, and ripped a big hole on the inner side of my thigh, in my brand new jeans. I was so mad. I grabbed the note, and climbed back over the fence in my new and improved hobo jeans. On my way back over, I lost my balance, and fell of the fence. I ended up losing the note again and planting head first into a pile of mud and pine cones.  What an idiot I was, I'd climbed over that stupid fence, ripped my jeans, biffed it and lost my balance, and lost it again. I was so frustrated with myself, I started laughing. I'm not sure if it was because I was embarrassed or what, but I randomly started cracking up. Then @ORGANIZATION2 started laughing, and when she laughs I laugh, because her laughter is so contagious. Pretty soon, we were both hysterically laughing like a couple of dorks. ""Laughter really was the shortest distance between two people"" that day. Even though I probably should have been mad.... But why do that when @CAPS1 can just laugh about it? That's what life is all about, living. With this silly but funny memory, it'll stay with me forever. Especially now that @ORGANIZATION2 has moved away. It @MONTH1 seem stupid, but it was funny to us. I guess it really was one of those ""@CAPS1 had to be there"" kind of moments. But it reminds me of the good old days with @ORGANIZATION2. It's good to have memories filled with laughter. If @CAPS1 don't, your life can almost feel dull without it. Even if @CAPS1 laugh at just the smallest things in life. That's why to me anyways, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people""."	40
21350	"  Laughter is the only expression in my opinion to always be positive. My dad claims laughter is the reason for his six pack, it works your muscles. @CAPS3 is very important in a relationship. If @CAPS5 don't have any kind of sense of humor, consider yours self inhumane. When it comes to my family, I am always @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is always positive and happiness follows is in life. If I have a problem I think of something that would make me laugh, a laugh is always nice..  Relationships can be created by having things in common, see my dad and I don't always get along. When we laugh everything else is silent, it sets the mood. If @CAPS5 didn't laugh around my dad he would ask ""@CAPS1 @CAPS5 got a sore sense of humor?"" @CAPS2 again if your not @CAPS3 with me at something funny, @CAPS5 must be an outsider. @CAPS3 is positive and positive energy is good. I laugh a lot, I laugh out loud. @CAPS5 would not have the relations @CAPS5 have @DATE1 if it wasn't for @CAPS3. Some people say laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I agree with that statement. If it wasn't for laughter I think that I would be very negative, I would be disciplined more and to think I would be more distant with my dad. As I grow older I see me maturing, I laugh a lot less... My dad also see's the change, we have grown further apart witch is normal with every teenager growing up. My dad is very funny, and even know I'm glad to be growing up I wouldn't trade the world for the humorous relations I have with my dad. Laughter is all around, I see people walking down the street @CAPS3 on their cell phone. I hear of the phrase ""@CAPS3 all the way to the bank,"" I would be @CAPS3 if I was rich too. Being rich is a positive thing, but if @CAPS5 are not @CAPS3 and happy in life then money doesn't mean a thing. I could be poor and @CAPS3, and still be happy. If @CAPS5 are not happy in life then everything @CAPS5 have or worked for means nothing. Laughter brings people togethe,r @CAPS2 is no doubt. I've met many people by just simply ""@CAPS3."" @CAPS5 will be surprised what @CAPS5 can get by just putting a smile on your face, or if @CAPS5 find something funny, ""@CAPS6."" I have a very humorous dad, I would not change it. I believe everything happens for a reason, and I believe that everyone deserves a good laugh and to be happy. I think they deserve it, it's unfortunate not everyone is happy in life, so why don't @CAPS5 personally go out of your way and make someone laugh? @CAPS5 don't know their situation, it is nearly possible a laugh can take @CAPS5 many places. @CAPS5 never know what a laugh will bring @CAPS5 until @CAPS5 find out? Laughter is a strong element in relations, and can base a personality profile of someone and who they are."	36
20784	 What makes you laugh? Laughter is a really good stress reliever. There are many different types of laughs around the world, some people's laughs are really high pitched and others @MONTH1 be very deep and low. Some other people snort and make other animal noises. I know that for me I have many different types of laughs for all the different emotions I feel. When I am upset I have a very distinctive laugh. Although when I am upset I laugh to make myself feel better and have a better day.   One time during a basketball game, I was having a really off night. Fouls were being called on me left and right. Normally when this happens to me, I get really mad and I lose my head and end up being taken out of the game and sitting on the bench. I absolutely hate sitting on the bench. This time when I got a foul called on me after already being threatened to be ejected from the previous game for the same reason. I decided to just smile and laugh about the foul and told myself to shake it off. My coach was very pleased with my change in attitude and just told me to play defense with my feet and to shake the bad call off and keep my head. When you are mad a person can take a lot away from the demonstrative looks you can make, although if you just smile and laugh about it, their reactions will be a lot different. I am not the only one on my basketball team who feels this way. A lot of us just laugh about calls that are made and just shake them off.  I am also a cheerleader. When you are a cheerleader you should always try to have a smile on your face at all times, and make it seem like you are in a happy mood. I play in a basketball game every night before I go out and cheer. I have to do my best to keep my cool while playing so that I'm in a good mood for after my game when I do cheer. Laughing helps me a lot with keeping my cool and relaxing while I am playing, so I'm in a good mood for cheer.  My coach is also very huge on people having positive attitudes. She tells us at practice that if we just smile and laugh about things that go wrong the outcome will be a lot better then if we have bad attitudes about it. I took this in very strongly and it stayed with me. My coach inflenced me to have a better attitude and since that day I have tried to have a positive attitude. I keep my positive attitude by just smiling and laughing when things in my life go wrong.  A laugh can go a really long way. I personally think laughing helps express the mood you are in. Laughing is also good for the body. Laughing can make you feel one hundred times better when you are feeling down in the dumps. I try my hardest to be in a good mood at all times. I really don't like being in a bad mood, it's really not fun. Laughing makes me feel a lot better.  I think that laughing is a very good function for the body. I feel that when I laugh it makes my mood better and the moods of the people around me a lot better. Laughing is a magical feeling that goes through out your body and makes you feel warm inside. I think everyone should laugh at least once a day. It will make your day that much better.	37
20921	" Being with family and friends during a memorable trip always seems to spark a smile. There are always times to look back on; whether they are fond memories, or thoughts of nostalgia. I was about to graduate, and my parents had just broke the news to me that we were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 after the year was finished. We had the date set; @DATE1, right after school was over. The first reaction out of my mouth was filled with entreatment, wishing for my best friend to join us on this trip. My parents took the time and thoughtfully considered all the advantages and disadvantages, and rapidly responded in the affirmative. I was thrilled to know that the memories I was about to create with my closest family members were now to include my best friend.  First thing was first, I had to get down to business. I needed to call my friend, @PERSON1, and ask her if she'd like to come along. Selfishly assuming that her immediate response would be an exuberant ""@CAPS1!,"" I was @CAPS4 first devastated when she postponed her response and didn'@CAPS6 seem too excited. I didn'@CAPS6 consider the fact that there @MONTH1 have been some sort of miscommunication. She talked it over with her mother, and gave me a call back. I had made the mistake of not telling her that we would have her financially covered for airfare, dining, and hotel rooms. We cleared everything up, and they decided she @CAPS3 join us. The two of us together couldn'@CAPS6 have been more ecstatic if we tried! @PERSON1 and I made a countdown board that started around two months from our departure date. There were many factors that we would take into hand while planning. As we measured out exactly how much time we had, we also planned which landmarks, resorts, and shops we would visit. Our family friend lived in @LOCATION1 @CAPS4 the time, so she gave us a tour of the island. Having such a close acquaintance to guide us made the trip even more fun. She knew all the local hangout spots, and had access to the military beaches because she works in @ORGANIZATION1!  Many humorous occurrences happened often while we were on that vacation, but some of the most memorable moments happened in the hotel while I was with @PERSON1 and my mother. My mom has always had a way to make every situation hilarious, so it was a blast when we went out on a girls night. First, and most significant of our adventures, we went shopping in the mall that was attached to our hotel. There was an abundance of varied small clothing stores, food shops, and jewelry outlets. One of our favorite stores that we visited was a @CAPS6-shirt shop with chocolate infused fabrics! We spent so much time looking @CAPS4 all of the designs, that I think we ended up carrying a wave of cocoa with us for the rest of the night.  As soon as we finished our shopping quest in the town center, we worked our way back up to the room, laughing and involved in pointless girl talk. The three of us girls shuffled with smiles, sore feet, and new bags onto the elegant, ornately designed golden elevator. My mother pushed the button to take us to our floor, while @PERSON1 carried on a story about plans we had the night before. Absorbed in conversation, we hauled our new things down the long hallway to our room. Realizing that we didn'@CAPS6 have a key card to open our room's door, the three of us decided that we should just knock on the door and my father would answer. ""@CAPS2 was supposed to be back from renting our surf boards by now, so why isn'@CAPS6 @CAPS2 answering?"" we thought, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS2 still be out on the beach?"" @CAPS4 this point our conversation died down a bit as we tried to figure out what to do. I sent a message to my dad's cell phone, and @CAPS2 said @CAPS2 was in the room. We ended up pounding on the door for a good five minutes, assuming @CAPS2 was playing a joke on us by not answering. After waiting a few moments in confused silence, I began to notice a low buzzing voice coming from inside the room. I turned to my mother and best friend, and @CAPS3 barely keep from laughing. It was then that it hit me, and I said to both of them, ""@CAPS5 guys! We didn'@CAPS6 leave a @CAPS6.V. on!"" We immediately halted our intrusion, moved as quickly as we @CAPS3 away from the door, and continued to howl with laughter. My mother had hit the wrong floor button on the elevator! We were so absorbed in having a good time that we didn'@CAPS6 even realize we were bothering someone, and embarassing ourselves! It wasn'@CAPS6 just one moment or one trip, it is now a lifetime of joy because I can look back on those memories and smile @CAPS4 them. It's these moments that I treasure the most."	43
21440	" Laughter is used as a ""cure"" for everything. Through out life, people underestimate the power of laughter. Laughter and joy have always been my personal way of getting to know other people better. I personally use laughter to create a bond that another person and I can relate at a level to be able to share our thoughts and our feelings through laughter. Laughter is very important through life. Laughter can help someone find people that have similar and common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Throughout life, there will always be that one person or that group of people that can enjoy similar things. I have been involved in a lot of social groups. In most of these groups laughter is a common thing between all of these groups. Without this similar interest, Laughter would not exist through life. Laughter helps through every day life. People find these common interests between people and start to create relationships between people that did not exist before. These relationships might be shown through co-workers, through authoritative figures, and friends and family throughout every day life. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" The relationships between people are built from laughter and enjoyment of being with other people. These relationships are formed at a social level with friendly people. Without these relationships, people would never have good times throughout their life. These relationships are created to help introduce the the stories about life. In my life I have had bad times and good times. The bad times that have occurred through my life are when family member have died. My great grandparents on both of my sides of my family have died. Another horrible thing that has happened in my life is that is that one of my friends died at an early age. What happened is that he was riding an all terrain vehicle. But the good things through my life have been breath taking. The one thing that has been breath taking from my life is most of my conversations with my friends. Laughter is the key point in conversation. When I first started my relationship with @PERSON1 all I could think about was being able to enjoy the times that I have with her. On the first day that we started spending time with each other we could not stop laughing. Everything that either I said or something she did was hilarious to me. The most common thing that we had in common was laughter. At every basketball game we would try and spend as much time as we can together. We try to get to know each other a little bit better by finding common interests through laughing because, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Laughter can help someone find people that have common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Laughter is used in a personal level to become closer to that person. Laughter can be used through every day life. Laughter is an element to a relationship that should always exist."	34
21375	 Moving schools is never easy, especially for a fourth grader. I had been dreading going back to a new school all @DATE2 and the day had arrived. My @CAPS1 reassured me as I reluctantly walked onto the bus. As I scanned the seats it became apparent to me that I needed to try to make new friends or live out my fourth grade career a loner. The bus ride was a quiet one, I did not talk to anyone nor did they talk to me. The school day started like any other. First the teacher assigned everyone their seats in groups of two, I sat by a boy named @PERSON1. At first I thought my school life would remain a solo one, I wasn't sure what my seating partners problem was but no words were being exchanged. The rest of the day went by rather fast, before I knew it it was over. I had made it though my first day of school. The bus ride home was not much different than the ride to school, as I got off the bus at my house my mother was there to ask how my day went. After telling her all about it she said that I should try to just be myself and eventually I would make friends. It was @DATE1, I got up that morning with a sense of new found motivation. I got ready for the day and waited at my bus stop, I kept waiting for almost a half hour before I went to my mom. After phoning the school we discovered that my bus had been in a minor accident so I had to be driven to school that day. My mom was surprised but told me to get into the car and she would take me to school, just as we were pulling out of our driveway I notice @PERSON1, my seating partner, was waiting at his bus stop oblivious to what had happened. Screeching to a halt my mom rolled down her window to ask him if he wanted a ride. At first he seemed unsure but he took us up on the offer. The car ride was spent in silence, listening to the radio. We made it to school and me and @PERSON1 start walking to class. I don't know what got into me but I felt like running down the sidewalk to our classroom. Sprinting down the sidewalk while @PERSON1 is watching, I almost made it to class until one of the teachers decided to open their door. At full speed I ran head first into the door and fell backwards onto the sidewalk. After rubbing a major bump on my head I turn around to see @PERSON1 laughing hysterically. I got somewhat mad at first until I thought about it, and it was probably funny to the onlookers. Scraping my self off the cement I walk over to @PERSON1, We laugh about the incident and head to class. That day we spent the entire class talking, even getting into trouble a time of two. Ever since that day @PERSON1 has been a good friend of mine, its been eight years since we met and there is no end in sight. Overall in my opinion laughter is an important part of daily life, and a great way to make friends.	37
21419	The @CAPS1 of Laughter   The @CAPS1 of a single laugh is quite an astonishing thing. Laughter has a strange way to either bring two people together or when used wrongly tear those people apart. In all of my relationships I have realized that being able to joke around and laugh with one another is a big deal. I have come to notice lately that I have an amazing best friend. @PERSON1 is always here for me even after the mistake I made that ended tearing us apart. Now that we have gotten over The @CAPS2 and can laugh about it, I've realized it makes being embarrassed a lot easier and brings me and my friends together. Even when a best friend does something that wasn't right and neither one wants to fix it.   The @CAPS2 began last @DATE1 during my @CAPS4 soccer season, and should have never gone as far as it did or involved one of my friends. It was the hardest thing to admit that I had done wrong; both to her and him. The day we had gotten caught is now what I consider the scariest and worst day of my life. The @CAPS2 has also become a big learning point in my life, I've learned that all my actions do have consequences and how to balance what I want with what I should actually do.   When I first started soccer for @CAPS4, I had never played with any of the people and I realized that by being the youngest on a @NUM1 team I would have to stand out and prove myself. Which is exactly what I did; just not to the whole team. After playing for about two weeks I had started to notice one of the boys who was on my team. I hadn't really thought much about it but when both me and him started to pursue our relationship it became a whole other thing. The boy and I had been dating for about a month and a half when this began to involve @PERSON1. See we weren't exactly allowed to hang out or even date for that matter, but we knew that we would take the chance of getting into trouble for each other. And as time went on and we had began to get closer to each other, we also had began falling in love. That @MONTH1 have been the reason I had chosen what I had but at the time it all seemed to make perfect sense.    Then the @ORGANIZATION1 came around and we thought it would be the perfect time to see each other, little did we know this choice would result in us losing each other, me losing my freedom, both of us ruining my parent's trust and the worst of all me throwing away a great friend. We didn't think of these consequences so we went through with it. He would meet me at the @ORGANIZATION1 and I would tell my parents that I was just going to be with @PERSON1. At the beginning and throughout most of the time everything was going well me and him were having an amazing time because we could finally hang out with one another and nobody knew what was really going on. Little did I know that my mother had called @PERSON1's mom to make sure that I was going to be were I said and with who I said, and as soon as she found out I wasn't everything went down hill from there.    It had already been a couple hours and we were starting to get hungry but neither of us wanted to eat the greasy food at the @ORGANIZATION1 so we decided to take yet another chance and leave, with me leaving @PERSON1 at the @ORGANIZATION1 and her not knowing were I went. As my mom became more and more worried she starting calling @PERSON1 to see were I was and of course @PERSON1 had no idea. On her list to call next was me. When my mom first tried calling me I decided not to answer and have her think i was just on a ride or something, but when she kept calling I knew that something was wrong. As I answered the phone I knew that she knew what I had been doing, but I still didn't want to believe what was happening. I thought that the only way my mom could have found out was because @PERSON1 called and told her that she couldn't find me and who I was with.    So that is what I ended up accusing @PERSON1 of for at least a month after it happened. I couldn't look at her or even talk to her with out feeling resentment and embarrassment. When everything finally settled down, from being caught to being grounded the whole @DATE2, I knew that I needed to apologize for the position I put @PERSON1 in. It was the hardest thing I have ever done. But now knowing that @PERSON1 and I can laugh about it makes remembering that time so much easier and better.	43
20813	" As people have bonded over the years, those bonds have been streanthend by laughter, joy, and trust. All of these are imporntant but they all work together to build these bonds. For normal people to enjoy one another they must have fun and fun begins with laughter. Laughter comes from the brain and if two people think in the same thing as being funny, it brings them together with their similar intrests.  By telling a funny joke or being a person who always ends up with a smile on his or her face, brings people around more easily. Since I was young I've always been a real happy kid and one who is easy to be around. I believe I am like this because my parents have always told me, ""People that are happy are the ones people want to be."" @CAPS1 by being a seemingly happy person it has given me the friends I have. Although I have never really understood what it ment because it could mean many differant things.  When ever I'm with my friends, looking back on it now, we are always laughing or joking about something. We could be laughing about ourselfs, or we could be laughing at a random person on the street. We could be doing absloutley nothing and be laughing at something stupid, but still be having good times. It @MONTH1 be starting an argument that is funny to us. If someone starts saying stupid stuff, then one of us will jump on the chance to make him sound as stupid as possiable. Most of the time we wont get butt hurt about it, but alot of the time we will take it to far. With all the laughter we have shared before it keeps us friends. Stupidity and pain are probly the top two reasons why we laugh. Stupidity would be if some one says something that doesn't make sence or came in at the wrong time. I have never under stood why we laugh at pain, maybe it is because we are glad that it is not us in pain,although sometimes it is, but maybe it is because we know that they will get over it. When someone is hurt badly, and another person is laughing about it alot of the time I will see them get angry because they are being made fun of for their pain. They need to just realize that it is funny for people to get hurt and know that they laugh at it too. Laughter will always bring people to relationships. It show common intreasts and what people can tolerate from others. Laughter is the main component to bringing happiness into peoples life, with out happieness and laughter this world would be supper boring."	36
20718	" Some people like making people laugh, I love it. I will do most anything to get a good laugh. I will make fun of my self, do insanely stupid things, and sometimes hurt myself (not in any serious way). When I was little I didn't really understand laughter. For some odd reason I could never tell the difference if people were laughing at something or laughing with it. I was kind of ""special"" in some areas as a kid (I still am today). Still at the tender age of five I loved making people laugh, and being special I would do even crazier things for a laugh. Mind you I was kind of a spaz, and a really big spaz. I was the most hyperactive five year old you will ever meet. For example one time I hit myself in the head with a hammer, another time I was dancing around in class with a pencil in my hand, stabbed myself in the head with it, and needed stitches. One of the craziest times though was a couple days before I had to take pictures and I wanted to go play outside, my mom knowing how ""special"" I was (I got it from her) wouldn't allow me to. The expert persuasive kid I was back then convinced her to let me go outside. Before I could even reach the street I fell head first on to the corner of the sidewalk leaving a huge mark and completely ruining the pictures. Although that might make some people laugh, this is a story about laughter not me being a spaz.  Now that you know that I love making people laugh, I'm ""special"", and that I'm a complete spaz I can get on with the story. Well I was in kindergarten and I loved school because I got to hang out with my friends and play with blocks, that might sound stupid but I was in kindergarten. The only thing I didn't like about kindergarten was bully's. Surprisingly I have never had a bully except kindergarten, but this was a bad bully. He would give me wedgies at story time and the whole deal (which was the best time to do so because the teacher could couldn't see). I still know the bully too, but he's no bully anymore, he's a goody two shoes now which I think is odd. Anyways, kindergarten was a very good year for me except one day (and every day I got a wedgies). That day is what this whole story is about, it's why I told you I love making people laugh, why I told you I'm ""special"", and a spaz, everything in the story circles around this one day, *dramatic pause* in kindergarten. It started out like any other day in kindergarten. I woke up, did my daily routine, hopped in the car, and headed to school. When I got to school I grabbed my daily binder and patted the education sign like a mall cop would pat the observe and report sign. I did all my work and colored (which was basically all my work). It came around break so we ran around the play ground and got are little snack. When we finished getting the last few drops out of our juice boxes we headed over to story time. We were all in the little circle (which was more like a deformed oval) listening to the story, right when I would get into the story and lose my guard I would receive an excruciatingly painful (for a five year old) wedgie. The story was almost finished and our five year old attention spans were wearing thin and we were getting all excited. The story finally finished and we were standing up, and this is where my memory starts to fade. I cracked a really funny joke and the whole kindergarten class erupted into laughter, me being a ""special"" spaz that can't tell if people are laughing at me or with me burst into tears. I remember balling my eyes out at the drinking fountain trying to hide my tears. One of the teachers tried to help me by telling me that they were laughing at my joke. It took me a couple minutes to stop crying but a little longer to realize the were not laughing at me.  To this day I still get reminded by classmates about that day, of course I can laugh about it now but that was in kindergarten, I'm in ninth grade now and for people to remember that is kind of crazy to me. It was a negative experience then, but it turned into a blessing in disguise. It made me grow into a better person, I can tell the difference of laughter and also be okay when people do laugh at me (doing dumb things to make people laugh at me is actually my forte). So remember, being ""special"" could sometimes be the best thing about you, what makes you who you are, what makes you great, what makes you grow, what makes people laugh."	40
21586	 When I think of laughter you think of memories you shared with people. When I was about six my family and I went to my cousins ranch in @ORGANIZATION1. The happest time started with us pulling up to the house as I slowly open my eyes from the long car ride seeing the porch light on. I quickly grabbed up all my toys and some playing cards and waited eagerly at the door for some to answer while the rest of my family are getting the suitcases. My @CAPS1 @CAPS2 came to the door first to greet us. I walk under his arm to set down my toys in the living room when I saw @PERSON1 sleeping on the coach. He was my best friend in the whole world and I always looked forward to seeing him everythime. He had brown hair always wearing wranglers with a trucker hat and his plad tucked in shirt. We always played gold fish together every time I came over, any time of the day. I was so excited to see him I started to run twards him when my other cousin @PERSON2 grabs me and starts to tickle me tell I fell on the floor and was screaming of laughter. My laughing woke up @PERSON1 as he came running to me picked me up off the ground and saved me from @LOCATION1. He put me on the couch and started watching @CAPS3 tell I feel asleep.  The next morning I woke up to hear cyotes howling outside while the sun was coming up, when I smelt bacon and eggs coming from the kitchenI shot up to eat breakfast. My dad and all the boys went out to go goose hunting on the farm. Around lunch time while my mom and @PERSON3 were cooking up some hamburgers the boys all came back in time for lunch. Lunch wasn't ready right then so @PERSON1 and I startded to play gold fish tell we were told it was time to eat. After lunch we went out to the hay barns to find all the rattle snakes and bull snakes curld up by the bales. Almost every foot step we took there was another snake curld up in the bales. Every time @PERSON1 would tell me to jump back to shoot the snake in the head. After hunting @PERSON1 figured we needed a laugh so he grabbed a bull snake and we started to walk to the back yard. I wasn't to sure what he was doing tell we got in the back yard and @PERSON3 jumped out of her chair and started running to the house. Everyone started to laugh when @PERSON1 cut her off and she was running in a circle in the back yard. @PERSON1 finally let her go in the house after about five minutes of giving her a heart attack. We all came back inside to visite in the house. @PERSON1 and I headed to play more gold fish at the table for the last time of my visit.  The next morning we woke up at five to start working on the farm. I went back to sleep in the tractor tell they were done. When we were done we started loading up all are clothes in the car and gave everyone a hug good bye as I stood by @PERSON1 not wanting to leave but my mom said I couldn't stay so she picked me up and put me in the car. As we pulled away I looked back to see them all waving good bye.  After we visited @DATE1 we got a call from my @CAPS4 @PERSON3 with some bad news. @PERSON2 was heading home and saw @CAPS5 truck on the road but when he pulled up he saw that he killed himself two weeks before he graduated. We went to the funeral that @DATE2 and when it was all done I sat in @CAPS5 room and only could remember all the laughs we shared. I knew to always laugh and always to remember the great times I had with one true my best friend. My memory of him hasn't gone away after all these years and because of him I always laugh when I can laugh and live to the fullest. He taught me so much from the little time he was he but whenever I need a laugh I think of the last time I saw him.	39
21156	" It was a cloudy @DATE1, but nothing to be sad about when among friends. This circle of friends had just spent the whole weekend together, and they were heading home. I was among this group as a young @CAPS6 who had known this group for three years. Three years before, I was shy, but something changed that. The group was called @ORGANIZATION2. This @ORGANIZATION2 was for teenagers and even some collage students. There were very few of us though. It was our last year as @ORGANIZATION2, then we would be kicked out of the church we were meeting at. Together, we made that weekend be are best and last @ORGANIZATION1. The boys were very comfortable around the girls, so much in fact, that they were going to make a deal with us. The deal was that during the car ride, if we rubbed their backs, then they would rub our feet. At @CAPS2 the girls thought this to be a crazy idea, but as time went on, that foot rub seemed really good. Three pairs were made, with a boy and a @CAPS6 in each. The boys sat in the second to last row in the car, and the girls sat in the back. I rubbed @PERSON3's back, but it's okay. Out of all the girls there besides his sister, I know @PERSON3 the best, so I was perfect for the job. This moment was a very giggly time for the girls, and a very relaxed time for the boys. While the boys were falling asleep, the girls were laughing hysterically. Since we had our feet right beside the boys for them to rub, then the easiest way to wake them up was to kick them. This just caused more laughter, and more alert boys.  After we had enough with the foot and back rubs, then we needed to find something new to laugh about to make the time pass faster. It was the @DATE1 before @DATE1, so our @ORGANIZATION2 leader gave us each a bag of candy hearts. The little messages on those candy hearts could entertain us for about an hour and a half. We would pick one randomly out of the bag and hand it to someone. I ended up giving both @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 candy hearts that said, ""@CAPS1"". They were very confused, but again it caused more laughter. @PERSON3 accidentally gave one to @PERSON1 that said, ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"". Andrew got hearts multiple times that said, ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"".  Once that was beginning to become boring, then we found a new way to make the candy hearts entertaining. We would read the heart @CAPS2, then give it to someone saying it was from someone else. Kyrene gave one to @PERSON4 saying it was from @PERSON2 that said, ""@CAPS7 @NUM1 @CAPS4"". Whenever we had one that said, ""@CAPS9"", then we would give it to @PERSON1 saying it was from @LOCATION1. Earlier she had said to him, ""I thought you were @CAPS10 for a moment there"", but numerous people thought she said, ""I thought you were @CAPS9 for a moment there."" @CAPS11, we try to make it up to @PERSON1 for @PERSON2 by giving him ""@CAPS9"" candy hearts.  We ended that @DATE1 with hugs, goodbyes, and laughter of retold inside jokes. A few phone numbers were exchanged, and a few that should have been weren't. The trip ended well, and everyone felt just a little bit closer. We could hug this person @CAPS11, or we could get this person's phone number. Something in us changed that we could be a little closer.  In my experience, I would say that laughter is only one element, because to get laughter you need to love who your laughing with. If I didn't love the people I was in the car with then I would have not laughed with them. They say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I don't believe this is true. I think it's love that is the shortest distance and laughter is just love being shown. The statement that laughter is the shortest distance is assuming that laughter is the cause, but in truth, it is the effect. Love is the cause of laughter. If laughter was the cause of love, then this world would be doomed to never know either. Without love, there can be no laughter. "	40
21207	" My knees were weak and my hands were slightly shaking as my rapid heartbeat was causing my breathing to increase speed and time. I wanted to get this over with, but at the same time, I hadn't the intentions to ever start a conversation, yet alone, @CAPS3 him. It had been a whole @DATE1 since I had seen my dad and I wasn't sure whether to expect a relaxed, laid back man, or an uptight, cranky one. So, I closed my eyes, took deep breaths, and decided to put this in the hands of @CAPS1. It was obvious that once I saw my dad, it would be a natural thing to talk to him, but I suspicious of his mood and if it would affect mine at all! If for any reason this did happen for the worse, we probably wouldn't be the best of friends for a matter of weeks. He'd then continue to pull the, ""@CAPS2 think now that @CAPS2're a teenager, @CAPS2 can do and act however @CAPS2 want?"" Or the, ""I'm your father, I deserve more respect!"" @CAPS3, the funny thing is, I never start any of these things. He chooses to start them when he's bored, I guess. Then, he continues to make me feel bad for his wrongdoings.  When my mother, sister and I arrived at the airport, (I'm not going to lie) I wanted to go home. My sister would crack a few jokes here and there and my mother would let her wittiness shine on me; even in the mist of all of this, they could only get a small giggle out of me because I let my nerves get the best of me. I didn't want my past three months of @DATE1 to be ruined by his coming home. But once I looked back at all I had done: two weeks in @LOCATION1, rafting, etc., I realized that I did miss him and did want him back. Don't get me wrong, my dad is a super nice, funny, and hardworking guy, it's just hard to work with him sometimes.  My dad's flight had landed, and after a solid hour of waiting for him, he came out of the airplane. We could @CAPS3 his eyes frantically scouring the airport for us, and when he found us, he gave the warmest, friendliest smile I had ever seen upon his face. Tears welded up in his eyes as my sister raced for him and my mom quickly walked behind. My legs carried me toward him and I soon found that my sister and I were competing to be the first to hug him! One hundred feet never felt so close yet so far away. Panting, we reached him with heavy legs and full hearts, now that we were with him.  The good thing is, an awkward moment never appeared. It knocked, but we didn't let it come through the door ; instead laughter came in its place. All of my troubles and worries were gone when he opened his mouth, and those soothing waves of laughter came out and were welcomed into our ears. My heart was lifted and my smile brightened. I knew that my father could not have been gone any longer. I love him! Laughter soothes the soul and brings joy to any situation. It is kind and has no regrets. The only mistake is not taking the chance to laugh in the first place. Laughter is one of the many things that holds me so close to my father today. Our sense of humor when we're together is never dull and is unforgettable. I trust him with my life and ever since I was born, he has found a way to make the best out of every situation by laughter. @CAPS2 can count on his laugh to make anyone smile and it is without a doubt, the most contagious thing @CAPS2'll ever hear.  ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" including me and my father."	44
20792	"  Laughter is the esscense of life. Without laughter my life would be meaningless, and without that sense of happiness or compassion, life wouldnt be worth living. My sister is the only person i trust with my secrets. She is the only one who makes me happy when i feel down. My sister and I, laugh with eachother at our own jokes. My sister is my other half and we share everything. She makes me laugh and is always there when i need her. I'll always be there for her also. Laughter is an important part of life. @CAPS2, my sister and I laugh and play. One day I came off the bus from school, all i could do was cry. As I waited for my sister's bus to arrive, the tears fell down like a river flowing. The bus appeared and a sense of joy appeared with it. @CAPS1, it wasnt the bus that brought my joy. It was my sister, right away she could feel my pain and noticed my tears. I could see in her face, the love and care. She asked me whats wrong. I could hear the worry in her voice. My river of tears stopped and I began to speak. I could tell her everything, without trying or holding anything back. The words flowed through my mouth. @CAPS1 need to think of what to say. I told her what happened without a pause. Afterwards, she told me something I'll never forget. She said,""@CAPS1 matter whatever happens, I'll always love you."" @CAPS2 we laughed. It was the sweetest laugh. A chorus of laughter filled the air. Nothing that people say about me is true, so I learned to laugh at it."	31
21626	" In most stories mothers and daughters are either enemies or friends, in @CAPS13 story however, we are both enemies and friends well; at one point we were that way. Not @CAPS4 much anymore. I'm sixteen now and she's forty and were just friends, I mean she's still @CAPS13 mom and she still can punish me as her daughter as she pleases but we work it all out and laugh it off. Approximately seven months ago @CAPS13 mom moved from @LOCATION4 to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 I chose to stay behind to finish high school with @CAPS13 current friends. When she moved, the way we acted with eachother would be different, and it is, we act completely different with each other we now cherish the little time we have and I'll explain how. At the beginning since as early as I can remember, @CAPS13 mother and I would always fight over the dumbest things, we never got along. And here is what I think the reason is. I'm her daughter I was born just like her, her face, hair, eyes, everything, even @CAPS13 attitude and the sound of @CAPS13 laugh. She's stubborn I'm stubborn and we both like to argue, not really with other people just with us two, but if we were to go into business together things would get done, say if we became lawyers we'd work great together because I inherited her work ethic and we both like to argue valid points. But as I grew up a bit more and we experienced traumatic times together we began to see the brighter side of life, and that just having each other around is enough to keep us from falling apart. Events in our life that we went through brought us together @CAPS1 it was all finished and done. What I mean by that, is we stopped arguing, we comforted each other when we needed comfort, we became friends, and I believe laughter had a lot to do with it.  @CAPS13 mom, her name by the way is @LOCATION5, once said ""Laughter brings two people together as a whole, the one thing that human beings all know how to do is laugh and its something we can all share."" @CAPS1 our life had settled down and we were able to live normal, like with a house and lights and a dog with a yard, things were good between us we still fought often but never as it used to be. Which would consist of throwing objects across the room at each other, like I said things are better now. We one night discovered, that laughter is something we both use to block out the things we no longer wanted to haunt us. I love to sing, @CAPS13 mother and @CAPS11 had me grow up around music like; The @CAPS2, @LOCATION3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and many others but we would sing a song together something that only the two of us shared and it was ""@CAPS3're @CAPS4 @CAPS5"" by @PERSON3. But we would sing that specific song in the car, we would sing it in front of our family and @CAPS1 the moment was over we would laugh about it, because for once was something that only @CAPS13 mom and I shared and it was special. Laughter played a big part of who we are as people today. There are always things people do together, @CAPS13 mom grew up in a strict @CAPS6 @CAPS7 home, she also had four sister's and @CAPS8 was a very serious matter. @CAPS13 mom and I went to @CAPS8 together and we always tried not to take life @CAPS4 seriously all the time, @CAPS4 while in @CAPS8 we would start @CAPS15 about some kind of ugly bug on the wall, or she would laugh at me because I would drop the prayer book on @CAPS13 foot, but we would always laugh."" @CAPS10 it or I'll bring @CAPS11 @CAPS12 over here and @CAPS3'll have to take an extra religion class.""@CAPS13 mom would say as I'm poking her or making fun of her and i would say "" @CAPS14 wont make me take an extra class I'll tell him @CAPS3 started it."" That's who @CAPS13 mom and I were and were still like that. Even though she moved to @LOCATION2 for a new job, and @CAPS4 she could see the man she loves more often than every six months, we still talk, and like I said we laugh when we cry and boy do we cry a lot, especially on the phone when I tell her I miss her.  That is the story of @CAPS13 mother and the laughter that we have shared for the last sixteen years, and to quote @PERSON1 ""@CAPS15 is the best calorie burner."" I do believe that and @CAPS13 mom and I see it as that, @CAPS15 is the one thing we can do when we don't feel @CAPS4 hot or don't feel like ourselves, @CAPS4 yes she is correct when she states that laughter brings two people together, and it's positively true, we have a better relationship than ever."	35
21285	" High school years are tough for many teenagers if you don't have a friend that is always willing to put a smile on your face during the worst times. I had a great friend named @PERSON1. She had that special power of making me laugh no matter what. We stopped being each others friends around the end of our sophmore year. It was both our faults for letting our friendship come to a closer. It wasn't like we made enemys with each other. But we didn't end our friendship so nice and peacefully.  The @DATE1 going into my junior year i had forgotten why we weren't friends anymore. If I didn't remember why we weren't friends anymore, then obviously it was a stupid thing to fight about. But things were said to one another. So it would be a lot harder to make-up. I really didn't want to be the one to apologise first. I did the worst thing to our friendship and just let it stay like that. It was the first day of my junior year. I hadn't seen one sign of @PERSON1 anywhere. It worried me because I thought she might of moved away and I didn't get the chance to say good-bye to her. Lunch had past and that is when I mostly saw everyone. And there was still no sign of her anywhere. As I walked to my last class of the day, I was seated in the front row. Once I was settled there walked in @LOCATION1. I had a little smirk on my face knowing she was still she hadn't moved away. She turned to look at me with a serious look. For that one sceond I had forgotten we weren't friends. My face bacame serious as well. It was great knowing she was still living here, but horrible knowing we still hadn't made peace with each other. But I didn't want to be the one to apoligise first, beacause I knew she would think I was the one to blame. So leaving it like that was all I could think of. The semester went by really fast. Seeing her everyday during class made it harder for me to even be in there. I lost a really good friend from something I don't even remember. I've noticed she's made new friends and has moved on with our friendship. She still once in a while hung out with my group of friends. When we both joined cheerleading we saw each other more after school. But we still didn't talk. It really felt like she was acting as if I never was a part of her life. At first I hated her for treating me that way. But I also had to take responsiblitie for what I had done to her.  One night I felt so out of it. I really needed a friend that could just let me forget about my problems and bring a smile to my face. The only person that came to mind was @PERSON1. I felt very alone at that time. So I decided to write her an e-mail. It would have been better to have aid it to her face but I know I would have chickened out if I did it face to face. So an e-mail was better than nothing. I told her I was wrong about a lot of the things that came out of my mouth. I told her how much I missed her friendship and how much I missed her presents around me. I woke up the next morning feeling very sick to my stomach. I didn't want to go to school but I did anyways.  During lunch time I sat at my usual place in the hall. @PERSON1 came out of no where and sat next to me. She smiled and said ""remember when you tripped in the @NUM1 grade?"" I could not stop laughing when she said that. Tears came down face face for how hard I was laughing. It felt like its been forever since I laughed that hard. We talked a lot about our summers and about what news have been happening in our lives. We laughed more than we talked. I really had my funny best friends back. And the laughs can go on again."	37
21345	"Laughters importance in human life   In life there are many things that make a person happy but none come close to the joy of laughter. @CAPS1 and friends always come together and share a good laugh, it's why we get together, to have a great time with the ones we love and enjoy being around. My @CAPS1 every year gets together on thanksgiving and it is always one of my favorite times becuase when my @CAPS2 shows up he really knows how to make you laugh until you drop to the floor crying becuase you are laughing so hard. He has that sense of knowing how people work and he knows that a smile and a laugh could turn someones bad day into a fantastic day. @CAPS1 is the greatest thing someone could ask for and when every one is together it only makes the time sweeter, now add a laugh, a few smiles and you have yourself a great time! My @CAPS2 has so many jokes and corny lines that he can use to to try and make somebody laugh but its not just what he says that makes it so funny, it is the timeing in which he does it. I wish to learn from him and use his people skills to return the favor and help people have a better day just by sharing a good laugh and put a bit smile on there face becuase not only does it make them feel good but it also can make yourself feel better knowing that you just helped somebody else have a better day just by telling a small joke or saying something funny that got there attention enough, and you never know taht person could one day turn back and remember what you did for them and tell somebody else and then it's a domino affect. He/she will tell somebody about what happened it and they will make somebody else's day better just by a small and simple laugh.  Most friendships and relationships start with laughter because one of you had the confidence to break the ice with one another, sometimes thats all it takes to start a friendship that will last a lifetime. So every one can share a good laugh, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from everybody is subject to a ""hoot and a holler"" every now and then. When I met now my best friend who is like a brother to me, it all started with a joke that brought a smile to both of our faces and an unforgetable laugh. From that day to now we are the best of friends that life could have handed us, so all it takes is for you to want to really go out and just be yourself and make somebody laugh.  Laughter is the greatest thing in life that people need to do every day to keep their spirits high and lively no matter the circumstances that your in. The military has to go to war and live in an hostile inviroment but they still find time to sit down as a unit and share a drink and luagh about something. It is in our blood to enjoy life so don't try to avoid people or the luaghter that wants to come out. When your having a terrible day the best thing to do is go to a buddies house and just hang out becuase the people that truely care about you will find a way to enliven your spirit and make you laugh which will bring a smile to your face and whole new start to the day, it's like a refreshment for your body. When i am having a bad day all i have to do is think about something that me and a friend did that was funny and it will bring either a smile across my face or laugh coming out and sometimes both. Laughter is the key to life becuase it can turn anything negative into a positive. When you go to a party with @CAPS1 or friends do you sit in the back and think about nothing, no you get up and have a great time with your friends and always end sharing a good laugh with somebody.  I believe with all my heart that laughter is not just the key to life but the key to the inside a person, it shows who they are becuase nobody can hide or shake the want to laugh at something funny, it's just not possible for somebody to do. Laughter comes from the heart and the soul inside a person and those two things alone are very powerful and when they want to sing and rejoice which comes out as laughter you can't deny the need. When two or more people are gathered the ability to create an enviroment where anyone can be themselves and enjoy the laugh not just fake it it what every person looks for so when someone said this, it is so true ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people""."	32
21077	"How Laughter @CAPS1 Laughter can be a huge help when going through difficult times. Like the time when my brother got ran over by a skid steer(tracked loader) at our farm. We didn't know how bad it was going to be @CAPS2 through our time of uncertainty our family was there to be with us and help us through and keep us from getting down. It was just another day on the farm and we were out running the machines. The day was going just fine until after dinner my mom had told me and my brother to go out and cut corn. ""@CAPS2 mom"" me and my brother said in unison. She wouldn't hear it and told us to hurry up and leave. So we went down to the shop and got the skid steer out. My brother, @PERSON1 still hadn't come down and so I started it and started driving towards the garden. I saw my brother coming from the corner of my eye. He was running as fast as he could and I yelled at him to stop and wait @CAPS2 he kept coming. He tried to jump on the front forks @CAPS2 missed and fell. I got out of the cab and saw him lying on the ground crying. My uncle was standing near by when it happened and he called the ambulance. We didn't know what was wrong with him @CAPS2 his leg looked a little funny so we looked closer and saw the bone sticking out of his leg. Finally when the ambulance came they looked him over and asked me some questions about what had happened. I told them all that i could and went back to the house. It was nerve racking to not know what was going to happen to his leg @CAPS2 we just hoped that it wouldn't be very serious. I spent the night at my grandparents house. I had a lot of trouble falling a sleep that night though. The next morning was @DATE1 so I had to go to school. I still didn't know a lot @CAPS2 i did know my brother's leg broke in a compound fracture. The whole school day my friends were helping me feel better by telling jokes and funny stuff and just keeping my mind off the accident. It was hard not knowing what was going on with him. Later that night we went to see him. We learned that he had just broken the big bone in his leg and that it had gone back together just fine. My mom stayed with him the whole time he was in the hospital so things around the house was a little bit different. Me, my dad, and sisters had to clean and take care of the house. It was a pain because I hate doing house work and having to do it all the time was vary boring. When my mom and brother finally got back after about a week things went somewhat back to normal.  My brother had to ware a thing on his leg that sucked the fluids out of the wound to help it heal faster. There was giant screws coming out of his leg that attached to a bar on the outside of his leg. He has healed up just fine though and has a giant scar where the bone came through his leg. It was very nice to have family and friends there to cheer us up and help us get through. And that is why laughter @CAPS1. "	40
21164	"The @CAPS1 We @CAPS2 in @CAPS3  Laughter is a usual @CAPS1 used in many different ways, to release tension, to appreciate a funny joke, or maybe just to express a giggly mood. I find that laughter is the key to having a close relationship with people. It could be because each persons laugh is personal and every time someone laughs they aren't thinking about how they look or what they should say next to fill the awkward silence, their guard is completely down for just an instant. Growing up with my father has proven this fact to me by having our relationship based off of laughing our problems, or difficulties with one another, away. Although I @CAPS2 a good relationship with my @CAPS4 the relationship with my @CAPS7 has always been a silent and guarded one because we @CAPS2 been unsuccessful in bringing humor to the relationship. Which proves to me the point that laughter and humor are two very important things in creating a bond between two people.  Ever since I was a young girl my father and I @CAPS2 always been very close and I @CAPS2 begun to realize that whenever I speak of him to an adult or anyone really, they will know him. Everyone always seems to know my @CAPS4. It might be because of his humor, or maybe because older women find him attractive, or maybe because he's nice, either way he's been popular his whole life. Also, ever since I've known my @CAPS4 he has never been much of a serious type of guy, he will make some sort of humorous comment or joke no matter the circumstance. It doesn't matter if I'm sad, or enraged under the spell of my adolescence and hormones, my mood will completely change and because of this it has shown me the power of laughter. The relationship between my @CAPS7 and I, however, has always been a rocky one, for several reasons I'm sure but one of them I believe is we were never capable of laughing together, or enjoying ourselves. See, she comes from @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 and in @LOCATION3 things are done a bit differently. Laughing or fooling around for instance is considered being disrespectful or immature, everyone is to act properly and children are to respect their elders. So when my @CAPS4 married her, I introduced her to sarcasm and jokes. I never got the reaction I was looking for, and since there was never that connection through laughs and humor I felt guarded around her. I @CAPS2 never been able to feel like I can express myself around her. I constantly feel judged and awkward and this has allowed me to see the effects of absence of laughter.  A human beings laughter is emotional and personal, like crying, it immediately allows you to feel happy, sort of like a drug. Once you get someone to laugh you are allowing them to open up to you in a small way, and not only are they opening up to you, but by the good reaction you received you begin to create a connection with them. If there is no laughter in a relationship with two people it tends to get awkward and neither person can feel comfortable opening up to each other. Since I am my @CAPS9 daughter, I tend to apply jokes in the same way he does. When there's tension, when someone's upset and I want to immediately solve the problem, I make them laugh.  Someone once said that ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", how I interpret this quote is that laughter is the one @CAPS1 everyone enjoys doing, it can either build or keep relationships going. It's the one @CAPS1 we will always @CAPS2 in @CAPS3. So c'mon guys laugh a little."	45
21519	"Library @CAPS1 @CAPS2 past @DATE1 instead of sitting at home doing nothing, I decided to get a volunteer job at the library. Some @MONTH1 say that a library is not a funny place but to my best friend @PERSON1 and I it was full of numerous and humerous adventures. There was the time with the creepy, stalker guy whom we like to call @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the time that we decided to be super spies, and the different people who decided that we were to loud and weren't to nice about telling us. We worked hard in that library but who says you can't laugh a little on the job?  @CAPS3 @CAPS4, by definition it means he is some one who likes to @CAPS3, but @CAPS2 guy was just to funny. One day @PERSON1 and I had just got done working and we were waiting for her grandma to pick us up, when some strange guy sits down and starts staring at @ORGANIZATION1 like he knew her. He then preceded to ask us countless questions like, ""@CAPS6 your names?"" and ""@CAPS7 you guys have boyfriends?"". Being me I didn't say a word and let @PERSON1 talk the whole time. He also kept telling us how beautiful we were, which made us laugh even harder because @CAPS2 situation just kept getting weirder and weirder. Since his nickname is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 you can only guess @CAPS6 he asked us next. Oh yes he asked us if we wanted to start a @CAPS3 line in the middle of the library. Thankfully @PERSON1's grandma showed up just in time to save us and we only saw the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 once or twice after that because he moved away shortly after @CAPS2 encounter. Being a spy was one of the most hardest and funniest things that @PERSON1 and I ever did at the library. It all started when we noticed @CAPS2 cute guy sitting all by himself at a table that we could clearly see through some book shelves not that far away. Being the adventurous type I talked @PERSON1 into letting me use her iPhone to take pictures of @CAPS2 guy without him knowing. Now some people would think that that was kind of like a stalker, I just saw as a chance to brush up on my spy skills. After successfully getting a couple of pictures undetected, I decided to get just one more before we went back to the other side of the library to see @CAPS6 we had. I was just about to take the picture when I locked eyes with the guy who was not supposed to see me. We then had to abort the mission and crawl all the way to the other side of the library so he wasn't able to see us again, so that he couldn't confront us about why we were taking pictures of him. The funny thing is the pictures were not that good and that just shows how bad of a spy we actually were. Normally libraries are quiet, right? Well @PERSON1 and I had a little problem with people wanting the library to be to quiet. On one such occasion a nice looking middle aged women was doing some homework at a table not to far away form where we were sitting. We were watching some videos on @ORGANIZATION1's iPhone and we had the speakers on low. @CAPS2 lady told us very rudely that she wanted is to move somewhere else if we were going to have the volume up because she needed to get her work done. Not one please or thank you were said as we walked away. On a similar occasion an elderly lady who was sitting a few book shelves away form us also asked us to be quiet so that she could finish her book. @CAPS2 time the elderly lady used her manners but she had a very rude tone of voice. On both of these occasions @PERSON1 and I started laughing shortly afterward. @CAPS2 just goes to show how ""nice"" people can be when they want to get something done. All and all that @DATE1 was one of the most funniest summers I have ever had. Whether we were getting talked to by some guy who wanted to start a @CAPS3 line or getting caught trying to spy on a cute guy or even getting reprimanded by not so nice people, we could always find @CAPS1 somewhere. Not many people could say that the library was ever a place where they laughed so much they nearly peed there pants, but @PERSON1 and I can."	37
21478	" I always wished that I could go back in time and relive @CAPS7 childhood. Knowing that that was the time when I was most happiest and the time I was just living life with no purpose, no plans. Looking down on @CAPS7 little cousins or brother, I see joy, and laughter, and silliness. I see innocent soft faces who have no idea nor understanding for what is going on around them. As I watch them slowly grow out of their unusual habits, I find myself back @CAPS4 the year @DATE1. A little girl, not in school yet, runs in her grandmother's yard on a @DATE4's mid day. She flops her pig tails back and forth while hiding her hands in her size @NUM1 trousers with one eye closed and the other slightly opened watching her older sister run around looking for a place @CAPS4 hide.  ""@CAPS1, nine, eight, seven..."" ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 sister, @PERSON1, yells out @CAPS4 me from behind one of the giant oak trees.I giggle @CAPS4 myself a little and start at @CAPS8. ""@CAPS8, four.. three.. two.."" I slow down dramatically, ""ONE!"" and like a rocket, I blast off the front porch with @CAPS7 arms spread out on each side, making engine noises, and pretended I was a pilot ""@CAPS9 on lock! Mayday, mayday! CRASH!"". I tackle @CAPS7 sister @CAPS4 the ground. I remember the look on our mothers face as we lay there rolling around in the grass laughing. I closed @CAPS7 eyes and reopened them @CAPS4 find myself in @DATE2. It was a few days after the tragic happening of @NUM2. Everyone met at grandma's house as always, kids in one room and adults in the other. I was playing in our small ball pit with the two youngest cousins, @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION1, when we noticed that there was a small hole in the wall. ""@CAPS6, look through."" @PERSON2 demanded.I took a deep breath and did what he asked.  ""@CAPS11!"" I yelled The little hole gave us a vision of what was happening in the room next @CAPS4 us which held all the parents and old people with straight looks and serious tones. I let the little ones have a look, they didn't find it as interesting as I did but they wouldn't give me another chance @CAPS4 see. I pushed @CAPS7 way through. All three of us looking through something so small. We kept giggling, and talking. We did this for about @CAPS1 minutes, not knowing that our uncle was watching us for at least @CAPS8 minutes. He motioned the other adults @CAPS4 see what we were doing. One by one, noticing that the amount of people in the next room was decreasing. Soon, there wasn't any of them in sight. ""@CAPS12 did they all go?"" We panicked.Light, quite laughing was going on behind us. @PERSON2 looked toward @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 looked at me, I looked down @CAPS4 @PERSON2, and at the same time we turned around and saw everyone smiling, laughing, and taking pictures of us. We stood still with red faces and soon started pointing fingers about who gave us the crazy idea of spying.  After that, it was like any day with family; everyone in the living room, food in the kitchen, warm hugs and kisses from grandma, people pinching @CAPS2 cheeks, big smiles and long loud laughs. I see friends shaking hands and kids yelling and screaming, people telling they're loved ones ""I love you"". I look down at @CAPS7 feet and with a blink of an eye, I'm back @CAPS4 @DATE3. I raise @CAPS7 head up over @CAPS7 shoulders, see that I'm in grandmas living room babysitting the kids. I'm sixteen this year, and I don't believe that there is one day when I don't laugh. Of course I can't laugh when it comes @CAPS4 all seriousness , but other than that, laughing is part of humor/youth. When someone tells a joke and you think it was funny you don't just stand there and say that was funny and not laugh. Everyone knows that, once in a while, they have @CAPS4 take a step back and laugh. I always wished that I could go back in time and relive @CAPS7 childhood. Knowing that that was the time when I was most happiest and the time I was just living life with no purpose, no plans. I had no desire @CAPS4 impress anybody. I lived @CAPS7 childhood well and when I think about it, I just sit back, look at everything that I have done, and laugh.  "	42
20885	   Humor is a huge part of who i am,and i love making people laugh, but this story is about an event that made my whole family fall down laughing on the floor. It all started one @DATE1 when my cousin received a trampoline for his birthday. It was a great day not only for him but for the rest of us kids too because we all could go and play on it whenever we wanted. We were always over at my cousins house after that. We would have competitions to see who could jump the highest or who could do the coolest trick. Sometimes we would fall off or one of us would get hurt and then my aunt and uncle wouldn't let us play on it for a while but they would always cave and let us back on it. It wasn't until a few months later that we all witnessed the funniest accident that any of us had ever seen in our life time. It all started out at my aunts birthday party. Usually she had it at some fancy restaurant but not this year, this year she decided just to have it at home to save some money. So we all show up for my aunts party my mom, my brothers, and me. First off we do all the regular birthday things, the meeting of family members, eating some food, and singing happy birthday. Basically in my eyes it was all the boring stuff. I mean come on there was a trampoline out in the back yard just waiting to be jumped on but the adults wouldn't let us get anywhere near it until we had ate. Finally everyone was done eating and they were going to let us kids go have our fun. It started off as normal as any other day we went to play on the trampoline but little did we know that all of our stomachs would be hurting from laughing in a few hours from an even that was about to transpire	34
21022	" I'm going to tell you a story of smiles, laughter, and love. The story of my @DATE3 and how I changed the a girl's life and my own with only smiles and laughs. I have three major memories of my time with her, there was the first smile, the day at the beach, and the @TIME1 at the @LOCATION4. Staring with with the beginning, these memories are about me and my neighbors exchange student @PERSON1 and they are memories, they are not perfect. The @TIME1 I made @PERSON1 smile. It was a cool @DATE2 @TIME1 out on the back lawn of grandmothers house which over looks the @ORGANIZATION1 gorge, perfect for watching the firework show. The lawn was even inclined so the you don't have to sit up. @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 came over to sit with me as i waited for the show. @PERSON1 sat to the left of me and @CAPS1, my neighbor and life long friend, to the right. I was very curious about @PERSON1, what she was like, what part of @LOCATION3 she lived in, how were her costumes different than ours. So i started to ask her some questions as we waited. I didn't get much it was obvious that she was shy, very shy. Finlay I got a conversation going between the three us us about the fire works that had started. @PERSON1 was telling us how the fire works back home in @LOCATION3 were much bigger than ours. Of course me being sarcastic i said ""@CAPS2 really"". She just smiled. the rest of the @TIME1 the conversations flowed much freer between me and @PERSON1 and it was a wonderful evening. Next we have the day at the beach. This happened about @DATE1 for the @TIME1 memory. @PERSON1 and me were good friends and she had lost her shyness and i was starting to really like her. We arrived at the beach the beach down on the @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION1. It was starting to becoming a hot day, a perfect day for the beach. We unpacked the towels and other random beach stuff. Soon all of us were in the water, @PERSON1, @CAPS1 (@PERSON1's host sister), @CAPS4 (@CAPS1's boyfriend), and me. In a bit of a flirting mood I started to splash @PERSON1 who happened to be by @CAPS1. This started a very large splash war with every one splashing everyone else. Every one was laughing and having a great time. It abruptly stopped because everyone didn't want water in there face any more. Soon there after I dove under the water an tried to lift @PERSON1 up and then drop her in the water, it underlay failed though because I missed and only caught her right leg. Nothing happened, just more and more laughter. That was a good wet day at the beach. Finally, my @TIME1 memory is the @TIME1 at the @LOCATION4. We had just finished eating dinner and it was @PERSON1's @TIME1 in @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. By now we were practically boyfriend girlfriend. It was getting dark at @LOCATION2 @LOCATION4 as we arrived at the @LOCATION4 forMovies in the @LOCATION4.. @TIME1 at the @CAPS7 was playing that @TIME1. I found a good spot and set out the blanket. we lay there talking as we waited for the movie to start. I had a flash back of all the laughs that had brought us close together. I knew at moment that I was really going to miss her more than i had missed anyone befor. It felt like the right moment as the sun was setting over the valley, I leaned in and kissed her and she kissed right back, I'll spare you the rest. Afterward we laughed and cried. For she was leaving early the next morning and we were in love. Yes I used the @CAPS8 world but it was and is true. We absolutely did not want the movie to end and yet it still did. As I drove her back to her host family's house we talk about the amazing @DATE3 we had together and all the smiles and laughs we shared. I smiled and laughed a lot that @DATE3 and it did bring me very close to someone. @PERSON1 and I still talk nearly every day it is hard but I've never felt as close to her as any one else. I will always have the memories of that @DATE3, the @DATE2 of @DATE2, That day at the beach, and @PERSON1""s @TIME1 @TIME1 in @LOCATION1. I hope you enjoyed the story of my @DATE3 and I hope you can have an amazing @DATE3 ,like I had."	37
21410	" When people think of football they think of the quarter back. When people think of basketball they think of the point guard. When people think of soccer they think of the goalie. Well when people think of softball they think of the pitcher. All these sports have one position where they are automatically put in a leader position. In softball the game always starts with the pitcher and usually ends with the pitcher. The pitcher is in every single play. Sometimes the pitcher pitches it and the big @NUM1 inch softball comes darting back at you before you even blink your eye and then the ball that you just threw underhand you now have to throw overhand to any of the four bases in a matter of seconds. To play a major position on a team and be a successful leader you need to be encouraging, helpful, and most importantly when the game is not going the way you want it to go, be able to stay calm and laugh and joke about the situation.I have been pitching fast pitch softball for ten years, and the compliment I get the most often is ""you have the best pitcher's mentality I have ever seen"". It is so stressful to be in a really competitive game and have the whole game on your shoulders. Three people on base, one bad pitch right down the middle and it is over the fence. One pitch can completely change the game! At times like these when the pitch just didn't go the way it was supposed to go and your whole time just looks at you with this gloomy expression on their face. As the leader on the team you can't just act defeated as you feel. I have observed numerous pitchers who just completely give up and look defeated. By being a leader, the other athletes look to you to see your reaction. If you look like you have no hope, then players assume that the game is over and the very next play they will mess up and so on and it will just get worse. By smiling and encouraging your teammates, they see that the leader hasn't given up and neither should they, this is always better in the long run. Players tend to look at who as the most authority on the field and respond the exact same way as they do.I play for a team that most of the players this is their second to third year. We are not a very good team but we practice hard and we never give up, it doesn't matter what the score is. In our league out of the seven other teams four are in the top ten in the entire state. One team in particular is @LOCATION1, they were first in state last year and were are very first game last year. By the third inning we were losing @NUM2. Even though I knew there was no possible way we were going to catch up, my goal was not to let them score again. In between innings I talked to every single player on my team, I tried cheesy jokes, inside jokes, anything to get rid of the tension. It worked and we played much better by having fun and being relaxed. Being in stressful situations people just have to find a way to laugh it off and see the bright side of any predicament and be able to get through it."	33
21458	"In any relationship, things like physical contact, verbal conversations, or any kind of outward expression at all is very important. More particularly, laughing is key as well, to any kind of iteracton with someone. Laughing says,""what you are saying is funny"" or, I'm enjoying this"". Laughing says a lot without saying a word. Think about someone you know very well. It might be your best friend, or it might be a family member. If you think about it, you can tell when they are mad, sad, angry, frustrated, just by looking at their facial expressions or looking into their eyes. When you see them laugh, you see happiness. Its so obvious, because their eyes sparkle, their face lights up, and you just know that they are cheery. Now think about when you are hanging out with your friends. Being with friends is always fun, and we love it. That's why we go do things with them right? And when we are with them, we laugh a lot. We tell funny stories, we share inside jokes, and fun memories that make us laugh, and we love that, we love the feeling we get when we are with them,and most of all, we love the moments that make us laugh. Maybe its a long car ride, a sleepover, or maybe its at a party or church perhaps. Have you ever noticed that when one person laughs, the rest of the group follows in unison? Laughter is contagious, making it hard to resist most of the time. Whether it be a joke that was told, or that someone made a fool of themselves, its always a favorite part of any gathering or party, or whatever it @MONTH1 be. Some people say that each time you laugh, a few seconds are added to your life. Im not so sure I believe that, but I do believe laughing is healthy. I know that when I laugh, i feel so much better. Whenever I get back from hanging out with my three closest friends, I feel great. It's like whatever else that was getting to me that week or day is just forgotten, and especially if we laugh a lot, it makes me feel good. When a friend or someone else we know is down in the dumps,what is the first thing most of us resort to? It's going to be making them laugh right? Because laughter is a big part of being happy. When someone laughs, they find it hard to resist being cheered up. For this reason, I believe that laughter is the best medicine of all. It's so hard not to feel better when laughing. Once again, I believe that laughter is important in any human relationship, because laughing shows that you are either enjoying their company, just like smiling at all the right moments, or making the right face when they are telling a story, and showing them that you are engaged in the conversation. If someone is telling a funny story, or a joke, laughing shows that you get the humor in what they are saying. If you are enjoying being with that person, laugh a lot. Show them that you love hanging out with them. People love making other people laugh. Whether you are laughing at a joke, a funny story, or a face they made, or all of the above, laughing is just as important in any situation. Just like the saying goes for smiling, everyone laughs in the same language. Laughter says the same thing all around the world. Laughter is is almost always a good sign, and means something is going right."	40
20998	" Life is so uncertain, unfair, and unforgiving, but one simple thing can change that view on the cruelty of the world; laughter. In your deepest concern in your darkest thoughts laughter can bring the sun. Laughter is a cure for the sick, a pill for the wounded, and comfort for the old. We give not even the slightest thought to laughing, when in return it gives us joy and happiness. Laughter is the light at the end of the tunnel, a flashlight for the lost, and a lifeline for the hopeless. Laughter truly is the cure for all of humanity. Explaining laughter is like explaining why we breath, we just do, it's a part of living. It's natural for people to laugh, maybe not always appropriate, but it's something we revert back to in necessary times. Laughing makes dreams, hopes, and puts to rest the thoughts of uncertainty. Laughing is a friend, a helper, and an icebreaker to many leaving joy and hope to everyone that it meets. It's part of life we must cherish every moment we can.  Many times laughter has helped me, but one time sticks out more then the rest. A moment, a simple moment were laughter changed me, my views, and life itself; putting my life into motion. With shoulders slumped I listened to my six period teacher as she droned on about nothing important. I turned around hoping to find something to distract me. When I turned I met eyes with a man I had never had spoken to, he watched me with curiosity waiting for my explanation. I wanted, no, needed to talk to him so I took a chance. ""@CAPS1 you watched wrestling?"" he smiled and chuckled.without that the conversation would @CAPS1 been totally different. He could @CAPS1 ignored me, but he laughed and that altered the course of my life. Soon after that, that man became my boyfriend, because we talked after I asked him that. That laugh made everything so simple, it made the puzzle fall into place. Moments @CAPS1 arise when laughing has dug me a pit of ruins. Even though laughing is such a wonderful thing you still need to be careful and know when the right time to laugh is and when its not. Again a moment that sticks to me was a time when I was young. I played by myself for the most part picking up a barbie I brushed her hair,""@CAPS2 come here."" I heard my father call.I went to the living room where my brother already reside and waited with my barbie. My father kneel to talk,""@CAPS3 going to be leaving soon because she needs sometime. I want you to go with her and make sure everything is okay. I want you to stay with her and I'll see you when I can. I love you @CAPS2 always remember that."" I bubbled with laughter, I didn't realize or even comprehend what was really going on. I laughed as we got into the car, by the time we were gone i realized how serious this issue was. Maybe I didn't hurt anyone by laughing, but it hurt me for not taking it so serious.  Life is never know, we never know where life will take us, lead us, kick us, or drop us. Laughter is an emotion and can cure the wounds, but its also a power we must not mistreat or misuse. Giving us joy and fun, it helps pick us up when we fall and it rejoices us. Laughter is a way of life and the savior of humanity."	36
20904	 These are some example that i remember when i had fun and laughter in my life  @CAPS1 all started in the @DATE1 time when i was like @NUM1 years old and my cousins were living with @CAPS3 cause they had just moved down to @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION2. @CAPS1 was fun having them around. @CAPS3 and my cousin @PERSON7 and my cousin @PERSON3 who lived right next to @CAPS3 would always ride bike. Some times joey would take my bike with out asking @CAPS3 and i would get so mad at him.he would take my bike like if @CAPS1 was his. @CAPS3 and my cousins would always race down the street with our bikes.  I was always the one to win the race the kind of bike i has was a @PERSON4 @CAPS1 was a @CAPS2 bike witch is a bike made for the dirt and to race. @CAPS3 and my cousins would go behind some apartment down are street and there was a ramp that we made. @CAPS1 was just dirt but @CAPS1 was hard. One day when @CAPS1 was raining so hard @CAPS3 , @PERSON7 , @PERSON3 and another neighbor of our asked us to come out side to we asked our parents if we could and my parents said @CAPS1 was okay same with @PERSON3. Joeys @CAPS4 said he could not cause @CAPS1 was raining hard outside but he still came outside. we had got all muddy i ad fell of my bike trying to go up the ramp while @CAPS1 was all muddy. then my cousin got like beat up from all the time he fell off the bike.  By the time we were done playing out side we were so muddy and our bikes were filled with dirt. my @CAPS4 was mad at @CAPS3 cause i was so muddy so she send @CAPS3 straight to the shower . @CAPS3 and my cousins had a good time that day after we were all done getting cleaned up we were playing super @PERSON5 bros for super @ORGANIZATION1. If we were not playing the super @ORGANIZATION1, riding bikes or getting wet with water gun and water balloons since @CAPS1 was so hot out side. We were probably on our way to the park for free lunch the school would always serve free lunch to who ever want free lunch. a lot of my friends would go to the park and get lunch same with my cousins after we would finish eating @CAPS3 my cousin @PERSON3 and my friend @PERSON1 would always trade @CAPS5 cards or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cards back then every body had @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cards. i had piles of cards. @CAPS1 was fun being at the park with friend and family just having a fun time eating playing getting wet in park. When i was in @NUM2 grade @CAPS3 @PERSON2 @CAPS14 and @PERSON6 @CAPS15 were like the three amigos we would stay at @ORGANIZATION2 house like almost every weekend. we would always stay at @ORGANIZATION2 house because his back yard was big and we would always play hide-seek and cause @PERSON6 had like a play room with a pin ball machine a basketball hoop and other games. One time on @ORGANIZATION2 birthday @CAPS3 @PERSON2 and @CAPS17 slept over at @ORGANIZATION2 house and we were just playing video games like one of the games we played was grand theft auto @CAPS18 @CAPS19 @CAPS1 was a cool games.  I think that laughter is a big part in friendship cause if your having a good time hanging around with your friend and just laughing then that mean that hes a good person . If your friends always make you laugh then there good friends to be around with. Like i would always hang around with @PERSON6, and @PERSON2 cause they would always know how to make @CAPS3 laugh .So thats why i think laughter is inportant to havewith friends or family. 	30
20829	" The bus flew around tightly wound corners. Beyond the windows, farmland, rocky bluffs, and peaceful rivers streamed past. Exhausted from the fourteen hour flight, I barely knew what time it was. The only things keeping me awake were the jolting of the bus and @NUM1 other @CAPS1 I barely knew gossiping quietly. We were going to visit and live with a group high school students, affectionately referred to as ""our @CAPS2."" I had met @CAPS16 partner, @LOCATION1, only once. Everything I knew about her, her life, her family I learned from maybe ten, maybe @NUM2 short @CAPS3 messages. Communication was going to be problematic. @CAPS16 mother started teaching me @CAPS4 when I turned two, but I was nowhere near fluent; I was self-conscience and uncomfortable around native speakers. @PERSON1's @CAPS5 was decent, but her family spoke only @CAPS4. Finally, the bus drove down the narrow cobbled streets of @CAPS7. It pulled up to a plaza packed with people. The doors hissed open, and we filed out into the crowd, standing on tiptoes to search for our new families. All around me, people chattered in a mix of @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. @PERSON1 and her parents waited somewhere in the middle, and I slowly wove @CAPS16 way towards them. Brigitte, @CAPS16 host mother, grabbed me in a hug. ""@CAPS10 gehts? @CAPS10 war dein @PERSON2? How @CAPS18 you? How was your flight?""  @CAPS11 of @CAPS16 @CAPS4, I faltered, ""@CAPS13 @PERSON2 war sehr langalso ich bin ein bisschen muede. The flight was very long, so I'm a little tired."" @PERSON1 took @CAPS16 arm and led me uphill towards the school, where our welcome dinner was being held. She explained, ""@CAPS14 is very excited to meet you. @CAPS7 is so small; we never get tourists. We only get @CAPS15 exchange students every other year."" @CAPS16 stomach was filled with that jittery-sick feeling of nervous anticipation. Normally, making friends was easy for me, but this time was different. I only minimally understood the language and culture of the people surrounding me. The long flight was evident in the sleepless bags under @CAPS16 eyes and @CAPS16 greasy, knotted hair. @CAPS16 jet-lagged brain wondered how I would get along with these people. Would I fit in, be able to slip into @CAPS4 life without many hitches or snags? We passed from the antiquated street to a dusky tunnel-like entryway. After a few turns, we emerged into an open courtyard. An array of food covered several tables, and the scent of grilling bratwurst wafted through the air. ""@CAPS18 you hungry? You should have something to eat. We have so much food here,"" @PERSON1 told me. I grabbed a plate and placed a roll, strawberries, and a sausage on it; I was too anxious to really be hungry. @PERSON1 steered me towards a worn table with wooden benches, where her friends were already enjoying dinner and a few beers. She introduced me, and I perched stiffly on the edge of the seat. @CAPS14 talked excitedly, questioning me about @CAPS15 life. As @CAPS14 loosened up, they began to joke, sometimes in @CAPS4, sometimes in @CAPS5. Some of the @CAPS2 teased me about @CAPS16 accent. It wasn't a mean teasing; they weren't trying to be malicious, just light and funny. So I laughed. In that moment, I seemed to fit better with these people I only sometimes understood. I was less a foreigner and more a new friend. Relaxing, I allowed myself to laugh at @CAPS16 mistakes and really enjoy being someplace entirely new."	49
20915	" @CAPS11 was @DATE1, hot and dry hadn't seen any @CAPS26 for a few miles. We'd been walking for a good six hours now @CAPS18 snacking on left over jerky scraps. @PERSON3 hadn't said much today still pissed off about dropping the can-tine, I would've laughed if the duration of our lives weren't depending on that can-tine. Hadn't heard even a grain of sand shift along the dead dry dirt that day under the blistering sun. No wind no nothing. I looked up the sun was at @CAPS11's peak yet @CAPS11 felt like a few weeks had already gone by. Finally gaining the courage to crack open my wrinkled bloodied lips I managed to sputter something, ""@CAPS1 sound good right about now, @CAPS3't you think?"" @CAPS2 didn't even glance over at me, I couldn't tell if @CAPS2 was @CAPS18 ignoring me or that @CAPS2 was sun burnt so bad his skin would tear @CAPS18 turning his head. ""@CAPS3't make me start singin, you know how bad I'm at singin. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 left me after I started singin to her."" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS4 so I go'n die by myself? Make things better?"" @PERSON3 finally speaking up, surprisingly with his neck still intact. ""@CAPS5 wasn't so bad, @CAPS18 try to imagine that can-tine @CAPS31 had whiskey in @CAPS11. Know how much you hate @CAPS11, yeah?"" I asked kicking a rock. ""@CAPS4 did I ever start riding with you and them outlaws, should've @CAPS18 stayed back home become a lawyer at least make a name for myself."" @CAPS2 muttered looking away. ""@CAPS8 you did, now we can go on ahead or you can go on back that way and get lynched. Maybe go ask @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION2's body back by the rocks, give you another reminder of @CAPS9'll happen back down that way."" I gazed into the distance not much to see, except a small brown dot couldn't tell @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was. ""@CAPS9 you reckon that is?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS10 some dead animal."" @CAPS11 had been a few hours since we talked, the brown dot getting a little bit bigger as we drew closer. I still couldn't make out @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was, but I knew @CAPS9 I hoped for @CAPS11 to be. My boots began wearing out a few years ago now revealing a gaping hole of which my big toe couldn't resist sticking out of. ""We're out of jerky, all gone."" @PERSON3 grunted as @CAPS2 tossed the sack over his shoulder. ""@CAPS9 do you think that is anyway?"" @CAPS2 spatted. ""@CAPS3't know but @CAPS11's pretty big and @CAPS29 sun is mighty hot, I reckon @CAPS11's got some nice shade under @CAPS11."" @CAPS11 was nearly dusk, but the dot had grown remarkably larger a mile or so away from @CAPS11 now. ""@CAPS11's getting dark, how we goin see where we steppin?"" @PERSON3 asked watching every step. ""@CAPS17 that hard to walk without lookin."" ""@CAPS18 think of @CAPS11 like @CAPS19 the tail on the donkey but having to walk to the donkey blindfolded."" ""@CAPS20, @ORGANIZATION1 sure knew how to through a party, her pies were mighty fine."" @PERSON3 began fantasizing. Now walking with my arms stretched afar I'd knew if we we're at the object. I retracted my big toe through the hole as to restrain from stubbing @CAPS11 on a rock. Suddenly I heard a loud thud, then I felt something smooth, ""I think we @CAPS28 @CAPS11,"" @PERSON3 said slowly, I now realizing @CAPS9 that thud was. ""@CAPS21 be some abandoned jeep."" ""@CAPS9 we going to do with @CAPS11?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS23."" @CAPS24 up over the door onto the front seats the cushioning was firm but comfortable enough to call a bed. I woke to yet another hellish sun in the sky almost laughing down on us. There were a few compartments in the jeep that I began to search through for @CAPS26. ""@CAPS9 you looking for?"" @PERSON3 sighed as @CAPS2 slopped out of the jeep. ""@CAPS26, @CAPS9 else?"" @CAPS27 searching through old dusty papers I managed to find a rock hard piece of gum, a cigar stub, and a half empty bottle of @CAPS9 I'd hoped to be @CAPS26. Oh @CAPS9 I'd given for that bottle to have been filled with @CAPS26. Whiskey was all that I @CAPS28 inside the bottle. Getting out of the dirty automobile I @CAPS28 @PERSON3 sitting against the front tire. ""@CAPS28 some of that favorite drink of yours,"" I said sitting down against the door. ""@CAPS29 all you find?"" @PERSON3 muttered. ""@CAPS30."" I starred out at the horizon, nothing but sand. ""I'm scarred, you scarred?"" @PERSON3 asked looking over to me. ""@CAPS31 thing that scares me is the times @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 caught me snacking on her pies before supper,"" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS20, that is true,"" @PERSON3 laughed as @CAPS2 wiped drips of sweat off his brow. We @CAPS18 sat there for a few days, @CAPS18 starring and joking. @PERSON3 was a pretty swell guy, @CAPS11's a shame I brought him into all of @CAPS29. @CAPS2 died of a heat stroke. That desert was harsh and unforgiving, @CAPS11's something I'll have to carry forever."	40
21133	                       My @CAPS1  @CAPS2 was a warm, @DATE1 @TIME1 in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. The stars were out and there wasn't a cloud to be seen. As usual on the weekends, most of the family was over; as well as some friends. I was just a little girl who loved everyone and everything, especially laughing. Anyone could make me laugh, smile and have a good time. One person, however, could make me laugh for hours straight. That person was my @CAPS1.  My @CAPS1, @PERSON1, came over to hang out with the rest of the family and friends that were at my house. He was talking, laughing, and having a really good time. Of course, I was only about five or six years old at the time; but to me, aside from my dad, my @CAPS1 was the coolest person in the world. That @TIME1, I was playing with my friends and not really paying attention to all of the adults. All of a sudden, my @CAPS1 came up to me, gave me a big hug and started to talk to me. I was so happy. Since I loved to joke around and laugh, I was thrilled to have all the attention. I used to call them laugh attacks. Anytime my @CAPS1 talked to me, I started laughing and I would laugh so hard that I couldn't stop. That @TIME1, I had one of them. My @CAPS1 and I were joking around and making fun of each other. Then, out of nowhere, I realized that I was laughing so hard that my stomach hurt. @CAPS2 went on for about an hour straight. That was long after my @CAPS1 left and went back to the adults. My friend, @LOCATION2, sat next to me and tried to get me to stop laughing. She was laughing too, but not as much as me.  Finally, after a long hour or so, I got myself to calm down. The rest of the @TIME1 was great but every so often, I started to laugh again. There was absolutely no way that I was going to stop giggling until I went to bed. After a long @TIME1 of having a good time, everyone left and went home. When my @CAPS1 came to say goodbye to me, I was upset that he was leaving, but I knew that I would see him again. The next day, I was right about being able to stop laughing. I still smiled and hung out with my family, but I wasn't laughing uncontrollably.    My @CAPS1 was and still is a huge part of my life. He is always the person that can make me laugh and forget about all of my worries. Even though I don't live near him anymore, I can still talk to him on the phone and laugh and joke around with him. When I go visit him down in @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 seems like we just pick things up where they left off. We don't even think about the fact that we haven't seen each other in a really long time.   When my dad passed away, my @CAPS1 was always there for me. He is the one male figure that I still have in my life. After everything that I've gone through, I could always count on him to brighten the mood and make me laugh, or at least smile. People really do need a person like my @CAPS1 in their lives. @CAPS2 really does help to know that you have someone that loves you and can brighten your day. All you have to do is talk to him. My relationship with my @CAPS1 is very close, and the one thing that kept @CAPS2 that way is all of the laughs that we have shared through the years. Laughter is a huge part of anyone's life. I have grown up around laughter and the thought of always being happy. Throughout my life, I have had to deal with pain, loss, and sadness. However, after everything that I have come through, I can always come out laughing. When I was eleven years old, my dad passed away. At an even younger age, my parents got divorced. No matter how much those things hurt me, I never stopped laughing and moving on with my life.	35
21127	It was a normal sunny day in the country hill's of @ORGANIZATION1. The sun was out and shineing on the creek that me, my twin brother and my best friend were swimming in. The creek was fantastic. It was a deep swimming hole that all the neighborhood kids would swim in. Since all the other kids were either too old and busy to swim, or they were too young it was just us three that swam in the creek that @DATE1. We loved it. It helped cool us down during the heat of the day. We would play games like @PERSON1, and tag in the water. There was even a rope swing off the little brigde that one of the older kids made. The swimming hole was the place to be that @DATE1.  Eventually we got hungry and tired of swimming in the hole for a while. There was this trail we would use to walk back to my house. The trail was the fastest way to get home. From the trail you could see farm animals grazing in the sun filled fields. The day we walked this trail was a little different then normall. All the farm animals were making noise. One of the farm hands was walking the trail listening for a bell. He said one of his goats had gotten out. He warned us that the goat was alittle mean and if we saw it to keep our distance. So we took the warning and walked on. Once we reached the gravel road that lead to my house, @PERSON2 said she heard the bell. My brother and I didnt believe her at all. We thought she was playing another joke on us. We walked on for about @NUM1 seconds. All of the sudden @PERSON2 screamed run! My brother and i turned around and saw the white goat with big horns chasing us! We ran as fast as we could. I tripped over my feet and fell. I got up as fast i could and sprinted faster. I could tell my adrenaline was up because I was running really fast and i wasn't getting tired. We reached the hotwire fence that surround my house. We all stopped and questioned if we could jump over it or not. The goat was getting closer and closer, we didn't have much time to deside weather we could or not. My brother was the first to jump. Of course he made it and soo did @ORGANIZATION2. I was the last one. I started to panic in my head. I backed up alittle and ran and jumped over the fence. I thought i was gonna make it but then my foot caught the fence and i flung over the fence and face planted it. It was super embbarrasing. My friend and brother were both laughing histarically at me. I could tell my face was beat red and i was mad that i fell. Again. Although i still found myself laughing. The goat had stopped at the fence and started to charge it with his horns. That made me jump and run. I dived over a row boat were my brother and friend was and I said oh my lanta that was the funniest most scareiest thing i had experianced all @DATE1. We walked up to the house laughing and talking about eachothers faces as we where running and how funny it was that i face planted it. They made fun of the face i made when the goat started to charge the fence. Even though i was embarrased that i tripped over the fence, I still found my self laughing and making fun of myself for what had happened. I would have to say that was the best day all @DATE1. We got up to my house and went into the kitchen to find my mom laughing so hard that she was crieing. We all asked her what was soo funny and she said she saw the whole thing from the window. We all started laughing to point we all cried. We all told the story the story to our parents when they all came over for dinner and they laughed and laughed. All of our cheeks hurt by the end of @TIME1. Laughing is great. It mends the soul. Plus its a great ab work out!!!!	35
20940	 A few years back me and my dad were siting at home watching @CAPS1. My little sister and her friend @PERSON1 were running in and out of our apartment. Every time they came inside they repeatedly didn't shut the sliding glass door, finally my sister shut the door but her friend @PERSON1 didn't know, he was running so fast and before he knew it he was going fast first into a sliding glass door!  My dad and I were laughing so hard i almost peed myself. After we finally stopped laughing and went to go check on him and he looked really confused about what just happened. We looked at the door and without a doubt it had a slobber mark going up the door as if his face was slid across it. Meanwhile after more laughs and fun things calmed down and we went back to watching @CAPS1. My dad fell asleep and his cat was laying next to him, my dad kind of woke up and looked around after a few minutes he started watching @CAPS1 again. My older brother walked into the room and saw that the cat was sleeping and took an advantage over it and slammed his hands on the chair. It scared the cat and it jumped about two feet into the air, Once again we started laughing really hard but this time my stomach started hurting. @DATE1 on about @DATE1 my dad my bother and I were working in our garage and found an electrical @ORGANIZATION1 starter. My dad told me to hold the metal ends and so i did. He flipped the switch and next thing i know i was being electrocuted. We all started laughing once again. Next it was my brothers turn but he said he wanted to hold the ends and push the button himself, when he did he couldn't let go because his muscles tensed up and left him @CAPS4-able to free himself from a nine volt shock. My dad and I fell to our knees and were almost in tears cause it was so funny. After a few more rounds of shocking ourselves we came up with the idea to put it on our tongues, i tried it first and my tongue started pulsing like a beating heart. My dad couldn't keep himself together long enough to keep holding the button. As a result to all these great funny times we had our @ORGANIZATION1 starter broke, we gave our cat away , and @PERSON1 moved. In better words funny times @MONTH1 be in the past but there always in your memory to bring a smile to our faces.. 	40
20804	Laughter is important in my life for many reasons. With out laughter my life wouldn't be as wonderful as it is right now. I have many people in my life that make laughter the best way to brighten up my day, like my friends, family, and boyfriend. I have many stories in which laughter was a part of my life, but I'm going to tell you a story about how my boyfriend used laughter to make me feel better and not think about my stomach ache.    It all happened on a @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 I was heading home from my boyfriends house. We were sitting on the max and my stomach started to hurt. I told my boyfriend about it and he told me that it's probably because I haven't ate anything. I was worried because it was going to be a long trip home. On our trip to my house my boyfriend was trying to distract me so I wouldn't worrying so much about my stomach ache. He started talking to me and telling me how my day was at school and I told him that my day was okay, not bad.     We started talking for awhile, up until my boyfriend took off his hat and said ''from flat to volume!'' @CAPS1 my boyfriend took off his hat and said that I bursted out laughing! I was laughing so hard that instead of my stomach hurting because I didn't eat all day, it was hurting because of how hard and how much I was laughing. I was laughing so hard because my boyfriends hair was all messed up. His hair looked so funny! As I was trying not to laugh I asked my boyfriend why his hair was like that? He started telling me that @CAPS1 he was taking a shower he had grabbed a shampoo bottle that said from flat to volume and he didn't know that his hair was going to have so much volume.The whole way home I couldn't stop laughing about my boyfriends hair. I thought it was so funny, that I had forgotten about my stomach ache.     Till this day I still laugh about my boyfriends hair and how it looked that day. We now have an inside joke and every time I remember that day I tell him ''from flat to volume'' and we both just start laughing.Now i know thatlaughter is the best medicine for me @CAPS1 I have a stomach ache. Laughter will always be a part of me and my life no matter what!	40
21389	Its said that laughing is a good part of life, its also said that its healthy to get your chucks here and there. its ture its good to laugh makes everyone a better person	20
20883	"Being able to laugh, is one of the greatest feelings in the world. Having family to share it with is priceless. Family moments like that, are times no one can take away. They will be there for you to look back on and just smile on those days. Not being able to laugh would make this world dull and a very depressing place. Laughter is the main connection between family and friends.  My family and I decided that for our @DATE1 break we would drive to the great land of @LOCATION1. Not one of us @CAPS1 how to get there, but my mom told us she would figure it out and for us not to worry about it. So the day we were released from school my mom packed us up and off we went.After two long hours of driving we finally arrived at the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The crowd to get across was huge. On the boat to get across, I thought about going up stairs to see where we were at. There it was @LOCATION2.  Once we got off the boat and through the crowed highways of @LOCATION2, and started to make our way across the @LOCATION2/@CAPS4 border. I noticed that my mother had a weird look on her face, the look of worry. My sister asked her if she @CAPS1 what she was doing, she replied ""kinda"". After hours and hours of driving my mother thought it would be a good idea to just buy a map. When we looked at the map we noticed a little town that was very close. When we arrived my mom said we will stay here for the night. When we all woke up my mother told us that she remembered that the town we were staying in is the town we were suppose to be in. After driving around the town looking for our hotel, we were all in the room resting from driving around. My sister made a comment to my mom, about how funny it was to watch her drive around and act like she @CAPS1 what she was doing. This made all of us laugh. We all started to make random comments on her great navigation skills. The rest of the trip we drove around laughing and telling my mom, don't get lost this time, and ask for directions if you need them. laughing about us getting lost made the trip a truly unforgettable moment.   Being able to laugh, is the greatest feeling in the world. To do it with family is a great way to remember fun times. Not laughing could make this life horrible and dull. Being with family and taking a negative situation, and turning it into the best vacation ever with laughter is truly priceless.Everybody needs to laugh in their life,because you only live once so make it worth while."	36
20771	"Someone once told me that laughter is the key element of comfort. I believe that @CAPS7 is one of the most important part of any relationship. @CAPS7's what brings people together. A perfect example; about two years ago in the middle of fall, I was crying about my dog passing away. My ex-boyfriend tried everything to make me feel better but nothing was working. I was so hurt I told him I just wanted to be alone and he understood. As he was walking away he slipped and landed in a puddle. The way he fell reminded me of the cartoonSpongebob @CAPS1, when @ORGANIZATION1 slipped on a banana and fell hard. I looked at him and his entire back-side was drenched. His cheeks were cherry-red with embarrassment. I just busted out laughing, I couldn't help @CAPS7. He saw that water had gotten all over me, then he started laughing. That was a moment of comfort brought on by laughter. Whenever we had a promblem, we could always laugh @CAPS7 off. That's actually how I met him. I was hanging out with a couple of my friends and we decided to go see a movie calledStep-@CAPS2. There was this one seen where one of the characters said, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS3 that was so funny, last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur,"" then other character looked like he was going to cry. I thought that was so funny. After the movie was over my friend @PERSON1 suggested that we go back to his house. When we got there, @CAPS4 was waiting on the steps for @PERSON1. @PERSON1 stood back a second then said, ""aw were you waiting for me little one."" @CAPS4 replied with, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS3 that was so funny , last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur."" I laughed so hard I almost went the bathroom on myself. @CAPS4 and myself were the only ones laughing and we just clicked. If he wasn't funny I can honestly say I would've never been with him. I love laughter. I believe @CAPS7's the easiest way to trigger the best emotions."	33
20805	" Have you ever wondered how you and your best friends even became friends? Maybe not, but maybe you have and couldn't remember. Well this story I'm about to tell you today is about how my friend @PERSON3 and I became friends. I'm also going to tell you how we have stayed friends for as long as we have and all the little things that have kept us friends. Admittedly we did not start off as friends who laughed all the time, instead we started off as a crier and a helper.  @PERSON3 and I first met in the eighth grade. I had just gotten called out of my first period class and greeted by my math teacher @PERSON1. @PERSON1 told me that we had just gotten a new student that moved here from @LOCATION1 and wasn't exactly happy about it. She also asked me if I wouldn't mind showing her around the school with another classmate, @PERSON4, I agreed and walked into the room @PERSON3 was in. When I saw her the first thing I noticed was her eyes, as the tears went down her face. Then I realized she was a very pretty girl who, like @PERSON1 said wasn't happy. I will admit i was a little scared to try and show her around seeing as she wasn't happy at all to be here. But once we got started she had calmed down immensely, but she still wouldn't even crack a smile at our feeble tempts to make jokes. I still felt like she should be happy and broke out the big guns. So I walked differently and talked in a funny voice, I even started saying random funny things in long pauses. Eventually she smiled, so I kept going. Toward the end I got her and @PERSON4 to laugh so hard we all almost wet ourselves. But as funny as it was for us, it definitely wasn't the last funny thing we did. You know the type of funny things that happen and no matter what, you always remember it when you see that person it happened with, right? Well to say the least @PERSON3 and I have a lot of those moments. Granted a lot of them happen with other people, but that's what makes it fun. Like this one time in our drawing and painting class we, @PERSON3, @LOCATION2, and @CAPS1 and I, were all in @PERSON2's little office getting a picture to draw. I had been hyper pretty much all day and so had @CAPS3 else. I randomly look around the room and see a really cute looking poster I hadn't noticed ever before and without realizing it I had said aloud, ""@CAPS2, that's really cute."" @CAPS3 started laughing and holding on to the desk to keep from falling to the ground. I still hadn't realized I said it aloud and was really confused but still laughing because watching them laugh was really entertaining. They finally calmed down long enough to say what I'd just said and I blushed but started laughing along. Now every time they see me and remember that moment they crack up laughing and they point to something and say it the way I said it. That's why I think that having the big memories of the really funny thing has kept us together. It helps us remember the fun times during the bad times. It also helps to keep our link strong throughout the group of our friends.  But the little things matter too. Every little thing we do together as friends helps us later. If we didn't do all the little funny things and only did either big funny things, or boring things, I don't think our friendship would last long. Like when we're talking and we accidentally burp or we fart while we walk. Or maybe when I laugh and I hide my face with my hands and my arms jiggle. Possibly even when we say something weird or walk funny because we really have to go to the bathroom. It's not just being friends that keeps us together it's how we are and who we become with that other person, I feel like I become a better person and I believe I help her become one too. Besides the little things are just as funny as the big things we do.  So as I've stated before laughter is a big part of a friendship. @PERSON3 and my friendship hadn't started in of laughter, it started in tears and grew to be laughter. Laughter had brought us together in an act of weirdness and it has stayed very strong ever since, not only because we had a lot in common, to be frank we don't really even have that much in common, it is because of the big hilarious moments we've shared not only together, but with other people and the little things we do on a daily basis that we find really funny. I do have to say laughter is probably the best thing to keep any relationship good and healthy."	40
21388	        Family trip @CAPS1 the @DATE1 my family and I decided to have a trip to @LOCATION2. My father, who had recently woken up from a comma, was in a state of depression. The doctor recommended that my mother should start planning family activities and do some over the @DATE1 break. I was twelve at the time, and noticed how my father was coping with the fact that he had both of lost his arms. He tried to hide the fact that it was too much for him to handle, but that only worried us more about his health. My mother, along with my sister @CAPS2 and I decided to go out on a trip -to distract my father- and hopefully get him out of his depression.  On the day of the trip we headed out at about @NUM1 am from the apartments. My mother was the type of person who would always be early for anything. Overnight we had packed our bags and already had the stuff in the car. Since we lived in the upper apartments, my mother and I helped my father -since there was no way for him to keep himself balanced- while going down the stairs. He didn't seem enthusiastic about the whole trip, but I made sure to get my sisters excited and they kept on talking with my father in the car. A few hours later, one by one my sisters started falling asleep then my father started sleeping. My mother was starting to get drowsy so I stayed up and started talking to her about random subjects. As I kept her company she began telling me stories about her childhood - the laughs she would get when her cousins pranked one another- and so on. Some of the stories were so funny we tried not to wake everyone up with our laughter. Even though she had lived a rough childhood, her cousin @PERSON2 was the one that had always known how to make her laugh.  My father and sisters woke up and started to get carsick, so my mother ended up exiting towards @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. As we began to look for a gas station we began to hear loud music, and as we got closer we noticed that there was a carnival in the middle of the city. My sister @CAPS2 who was @NUM2-years-old at the time began complaining along with @PERSON1 who was eight-years-old. I tried to convince my parents, and my mother agreed but my father only got mad. That was until my sister @CAPS4 who was @NUM3-years-old began on ranting on and on, until my father finally agreed.  My mother parked the car at the nearby park and my sisters ran ahead of us to the carnival. My mother tried to catch up with them while I locked the car from the inside. As we arrived to the carnival, we saw stands filled with jewelry, clothing, and other small items. We kept on walking and saw a group of gypsies dancing on stage. Later on a comedian went up and he made everyone laugh in the audience. After watching the gypsies and the comedian, we started to look around. We ended up buying three @CAPS5 parasols and the fourth parasol was free. We thanked the saleswoman as we opened our parasols for some shade. The @DATE1 heat was starting to get worse, so we headed towards the car.  As we reached the car, my mother's face turned pale, she had left the car keys inside. She began arguing with me, and I began regretting the whole trip. I was exhausted and didn't want to argue. My father finally interrupted by telling us that he was going to search for a wire hanger from one of the stands in the carnival. As he left with my sister @PERSON1, the rest of us began walking towards the park. @CAPS4 began pouting and my mother kept on blaming me for locking the car, meanwhile I pretended I was deaf. After my father came back with a wire hanger, I began straightening it out and bending one side to create a hook. After many tries I still couldn't open the car, and my arms began to hurt. An old couple riding on a motorcycle parked next to us and asked us what we were doing. My father told them we had left the keys inside car. The old man helped us open one of the car doors. We thanked him and said goodbye as we went inside the car.  We decided to head home, exhausted from the whole trip. Even though the destination had changed we enjoyed the trip, and everyone quickly forgot about the incident with the keys. My mother and sisters started joking around, and for the first time since coming out of the hospital my father began laughing.	40
21574	"     Laughter means a lot in a relationship in @CAPS4 opinion. Laughter can mean a few things. It can mean that you are having fun and that you're enjoying life. All of @CAPS4 friendships and relationships contain laughter. Half of the time we laugh, the other half we express ourselves. Laughter could also mean the beginning or ending of a relationship. A lot of people would think that laughter is a joyful reaction, but sometimes a person could be laughing because they are nervous. But I think what we are talking about here is the joyful kind. All of @CAPS4 friendships contain laughter, but they also contain the moments when someone needs to be listened to or heard. One of @CAPS4 friendships that contains a lot of laughter is with @CAPS4 friend @PERSON3. Ever since the day that I first met her, we've laughed a lot. Usually, its @PERSON3 being the joker and me being the audience along with a few other people. But, there are also moments that don't have laughing involved. Moments, when @PERSON3 can be a great listener.     Making jokes and giggling can show how close you are to someone. Like @CAPS4 friend @PERSON2 and I. She's one of @CAPS4 closest friends. We share everything with each other, well at least almost everything. We tell each other whats going on in our families and all that good stuff. But there are so many moments that are just filled with laughing, giggling and making up jokes about @CAPS5 knows what. Whether its twisted in some weird way or even when it doesn't make sense we still laugh about it. It doesn't matter how stupid I @MONTH1 act around her, we always laugh it off and make fun of each other. Not in a bad way.      Usually, when people fall down, they feel embarrassed or scared of what everyone else would say. There was a time that I was sitting on @CAPS4 friend, @PERSON4's skateboard, just sitting and rolling up and down the sidewalk, when I came upon a bump. I'm pretty sure you could guess what happens next. I flew off the skateboard and landed on @CAPS4 butt on the cement. I sat there for a second and just stared. Shocked that I had flew off of a skateboard while just sitting down. Pretty disappointing. But the next thing I knew, I was laughing, like it didn't even matter that I had just landed on @CAPS4 butt, infront of one of @CAPS4 friends. @PERSON4 was laughing too. I didn't mind. @PERSON4 didn't even tease me about it. Laughing can shrug things off your shoulders helping you turn it into a joke. That's what I did.     @CAPS4 relationship with @CAPS4 @CAPS1 is full of jokes. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 is the type of guy @CAPS5 just loves to tell jokes and/or act like some historical figure to confuse people. When I answer the phone half of the time @CAPS4 @CAPS1 tries to see if I'll fall for one of his little tricks. One time, he tried saying that he was @PERSON1 and that he invented all these different electrical items. I shook @CAPS4 head was like, ""@CAPS1, you're not very good at acting."" @CAPS2 he said, ""I'm not your @CAPS1. this is seriously @PERSON1."" I laughed and said ""@PERSON1 is dead. How could he be talking to me over the phone when he's dead, @CAPS1? I know it's you."" @CAPS4 @CAPS1 laughed, ""@CAPS5 told you I was dead? Obviously, I'm still here, little lady."" I smiled, ""@CAPS6 huh. Sure. And I'm not a little lady."" ""@CAPS7 fine, I give up. You can't get a joke, can you?"" , he said. I frowned, ""Of course I can what are you talking about, @LOCATION1? It's just you're not very good at acting."" ""@CAPS7 sure, blame it on me."" , he laughed, ""where's your mother?"" That's when the joke ended of course, but @CAPS4 @CAPS1 and I actually have a strong relationship. He's @CAPS4 adopted @CAPS1, in case that hasn't been mentioned. So, when I first met him, we weren't as close as you could probably guess. But after a year, we got closer and I learned that I could trust him. And that half of what he says is basically a joke. Sometimes, I wonder if he ever knows how to be serious, so he doesn't confuse people, for example, me.     For me, relationships should always have laughter otherwise it just makes it all serious. Making it very hard to stay close, in @CAPS4 opinion. And me, myself, I like laughing and having close friends. Because when I'm feeling down, it's always nice to have someone there to make you smile and laugh. It's a great quality to be able to laugh and help people. Without laughter in the world, like I said before the world would be too serious, way too serious. @CAPS5 would want that? I wouldn't. That would be terrible.  When people laugh, it makes the world a better place to live in, in @CAPS4 opinion. Laughing is a gift, a very special gift."	40
21577	" Laughter is important in any relationship because it brings two people closer, connecting them between something they have in common forming an unbreakable bond between the two of them laughter is the glue that holds together any relationship and keeps a person from breaking into tears when something wrong happens. In fact without laughter I probably would not even get through my day to day school life. Without laughter one class in particular would be a nightmare.  In @ORGANIZATION1 we are dissecting cats and we are working with a partner, if I was not making jokes and laughing while I worked, my partner and I would have hated each other. We got to choose our partner and work at a lab station with another pair of students, fortunately for me I knew all of the people I was working near and with, and I was friends with all of them. we had to wear gloves and suits so we didn't get fluids or ""cat juices"" on us. First, we had to skin the cat, of course there is more than one way to do this, you can cut, slice, rip, and pull to remove the skin. Then we had to view and identify the muscles this was especially hard because we could not tell where one muscle begins and another ends. Next we had to remove the muscles and identify the bones and digestive organs. After we identified the bones and digestive organs, we had to remove them and view the stomach, liver, intestines, and kidneys. We had to cut open the stomach, intestines, and kidneys to look at the structure of them. lastly, we had to remove the heart and lungs. The class was told we are doing dissections for about a month and it has only been three weeks. You can only imagine how horrible and fascinating it is and how much I need laughter to keep myself together and from going insane. My friends keep me from breaking into tears and keep me laughing.  Dissecting cats in @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was challenging not only physically, but mentally challenging as well. It stressful, fascinating, and gross, and without the jokes and the laughter I do not think I would have never made it through it. My friends support there when I needed it guided me through the terrible assignment. So as you can clearly see, without laughter I would not be able to do some of the day to day things I do at school."	40
20888	 @CAPS1 is my personal belief that that hilarity and giddiness are the best emotional states to be in. Therefore @CAPS1 makes sense that people who find laughter in the same things would be of good relations. @CAPS1 is because of their likeness of minds that they are connected and find happiness in each others company. My story is an example of laughter's connection between people and the strength of the bond @CAPS1 forms. Picture the scene: @CAPS1 was @DATE2 on the north side of @CAPS2. Hood below the infamous snow dome. Standing there was a weak eleven year old boy who thought he could not continue further. Patiently standing beside him was his father, a climbing veteran who had scaled mountains in @LOCATION1,and @LOCATION2. The boy was tired, he could not put one foot in front of the other. His muscles screamed in protest as the blisters on his heels throbbed in harmony. The @DATE1 sun beat down on him while the snow gave way and brought him to the ground. @CAPS1 was as if the mountain wanted him to fail and was urging him to give in and cry in defeat. Fatigue then consumed the boy adding fifty pounds to each of his limbs. His brain had dimmed as well leaving him capable of only simple thoughts like putting on foot in front of the other. He began finding any excuse to stop and made them often. The boy's father had tried everything he could think of to give his son the incentive to keep going with no avail. He tried another tack, he began to tell the boy stories, perhaps in hope that @CAPS1 would take the boy's mind of the excruciating pain.And to the relief of all concerned, @CAPS1 proved effective. What was most interesting about the whole event is @CAPS1 wasn't the content of the stories that helped, @CAPS1 was the humorous and sarcastic tone that made the real difference.An infusion that I would describe as a solution of laughing gas and an energy drink washed over me. In the presence of my father's humor I found the strength to keep going . @CAPS1 was like I had been completely recharged and refreshed. My arms and leg which had previously felt like solid pipes of lead lightened considerably. The stabbing agony in my muscles and joints frayed away and left. The dull pulsing of the blisters on my heels were silenced. This was all due to someones thoughts and ideas tickling my funny bone. I believe laughter to be the anesthetic of nature,the emotional element that keeps the world sane. @CAPS1 was at that point in time when I realized what I respected most about my father. I had no shortage of traits to choose from. He had a indomitable work ethic, was a great teacher, and possessed an extraordinary amount of energy. But what I respected most about him was that we were similar in our humor. We laughed at the same things and found hilarity at each others comment's. @CAPS1 forged a strong bond between us, one constructed of euphoria and glee that continues to this day. Whenever I am morose he always manages to find away to bring a smile to my face and I found that I to had the same ability. To my belief a relationship formed on laughter is the strongest one of all. Laughter is a force that paves the way to friendship,respect,and love. You cannot have hope for a better future if you do not have laughter. @CAPS1 is the drug that descends from the heavens. A drug that runs through the bloodstream of society. In the process freeing the minds from the stress and worries of what tomorrow will bring. Laughter can unite a population and instill a feeling of friendship in a society. Have you ever laughed at something and then turned to find that at the exact same moment someone across the room had also began to laugh. Then your eyes lock and a slow smile spread's throughout both of your faces, as you realize that you are not alone in how you think and what you laugh at. That connective force is a result of the power of laughter.	50
21356	" In all of the times people paid a lot of attention to laughter. We can't imagine our lives without @CAPS9. We @CAPS8 every day, make jokes,smile. For me laughter always was one of the best things in the world! @CAPS9 helped me so many times in the most difficult situations. I want to tell you one story of my life when laughter played a huge role.@CAPS9 all started @DATE1 in @DATE2. I was living in @LOCATION2 at that time and was trying to get a scholarship to go to the @LOCATION2 for one @DATE1 as an exchange student. To do this I had to pass a lot of tests, to write millions of essays, go through all the paper work... One of the things that i had to do was to talk to the group of other participants and two @CAPS1 for about one hour. So, people who chose the kids to go abroad will look at how we can communicate with others. Can you imagine speaking foreign language with group of people who you have never seen before? No. Especially when all of you know that only one from the whole group will go to @LOCATION1. You know that everyone will try to be the best, the leader, and hardly ever will let others to say something. But I still hoped everything would be fine.I remember that day as if @CAPS9 was yesterday. Everything in details. @CAPS9 was @DATE3 @TIME1, when I came into the white big building of @ORGANIZATION1 where the competition was going to be.I came in the class and two @CAPS1 introduces us to each other. And at that exact moment, when I saw other three people, at that exact second I realized that I actually had to worry! I saw their faces. They thought the same. We had nothing in common. At all. They all looked different. One girl was all in black. No kidding. black big shoes looked alike to old army ones that my grandfather has, black skirt was longer then the girl, black ties, dark t-shirt, three or four sizes bigger then the girl; you can not even imagine how dark her short straight hair were. She looked like if she was a part of the darkest night of the @DATE1. Another girl was a complete ""barbie girl"". You know, typical @CAPS3- two good for everyone. She was tall, thin, long blond hair and pink clothes. All pink. Bright-pink jeans, light-pink top and high heels. I remember her saying the girl in black something like "" @CAPS4, I am the best one here"". Nothing else about her, just @CAPS3. Also there was one boy. He was a wonderful example of rap person. All his look from shoes to attitude were just screaming about how much he likes rap. No, loves rap. Big blue jeans, cool in rep companies @ORGANIZATION2 shoes, white tee-shirt with a face of popular in @LOCATION2 rap musician, a hoodoo and a big hat. Also, he had a backpack and i was able to hear music from his I-pod. Well, me, I was in new green pants, grey top, black cardigan, nice grey purse and black flats.. I looked like a girl who loves style, I guess. I can not tell you what they thought about me. I just don not know. But I'm pretty sure that I was a person who just reads magazines all the time and watching @CAPS6 fashion shows. So, we all looked super different from each other and seemed as we were interested just in our own thing. And in nothing else.I didn't understand how we were able to be in the same group. But we were. The first ten minutes were awkward. We did not know what to talk about since we all were so different. Two @CAPS1 who were making notes on how how our conversation is going decided to help us.They gave us a random word, something like "" jungadzhumba"" and told us to think about what @CAPS9 is and to perform @CAPS9. That seemed to be an interesting thing to me but not for others. The girl-in-black said that @CAPS9 is stupid. And then, the next second the thing that changed everything happened. The boy said a joke about @CAPS9. Yes, just a joke, and i do not even remember what @CAPS9 was, the only thing is that @CAPS9 was really funny. We started to @CAPS8. And the laughter helped us. We were talking so long, more than one hour, but @CAPS9 seemed for us so fast! We were talking about everything in the world! So many topics, we were talking in that room, and then after in the restaurant, and in the subway on the way home... @CAPS9 was wonderful time! That day is very important for me now, because at that day I realized that laughter is a key for everything. I've heard @CAPS9 before, but the real understanding was at that @DATE3. Now my favorite phrase is: ""@CAPS8, if you don't know what to do, just @CAPS8!"" @CAPS9 will help you."	37
21190	" When I was in what I believe to be the sixth grade I went to @ORGANIZATION1. This year I felt as if I was old enough to ride the "" big kid"" rides which I had never done before. I remember walking up to the entrance of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 hotel with my mom, older sister @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1 little sister @CAPS3. We had to go though there because it was the fastest way in to the park. There were to giant stain glass like windows that led into the lobby of the hotel. The door were beautiful. They had an outdoor seen on them there were bears, fish, trees, rivers @ORGANIZATION1 mountains. We all walked in to the hotel. The ceilings must have been twenty feet tall. We walk all the way though the lobby @ORGANIZATION1 followed the signs till we got to the park entrance. There was a man made mountain in the middle shaped like a grizzly bear that one of the rides was built around. It was early in the morning so the @LOCATION1 heat had not yet set in completely. We started out with the smaller rides @ORGANIZATION1 side attractions like it's tough to be a bug @NUM1,shopping in the park @ORGANIZATION1 parades. My mom was determent to get back in time to see @LOCATION2 on stage but we never made it back in time. It was about noon @ORGANIZATION1 the sun was hot. We were making our way to the pier. the song @ORGANIZATION3 by the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 was playing in the back ground. There were old sunscreen advertisements painted on the fence that was surrounding that end of the park. on the opposite side of the pier was a man made ocean that was so blue from all the dye it was unbelievable. It kinda looked like the water in the toilet when you put the blue cleaning product in it. The air smelled like fried food @ORGANIZATION1 popcorn, it was making me @LOCATION3. We continued walking until be got to the roller coaster @ORGANIZATION2'. There was a fifteen minuet wait time for the ride which wasn't long. my older sister @ORGANIZATION1 i jumped in line @ORGANIZATION1 began to wait. I had never been on a roller coaster this big before so I didn't know what to expect. I had butterfly in my stomach, I was getting nervous but didn't want to back down.  finally we came to the front of the line. the man standing there working the ride asked ""how many?"". my sister held up two fingers @ORGANIZATION1 the man pointed at the ground next to him @ORGANIZATION1 said ""row eight"". The next set of cars came in @ORGANIZATION1 they ushered us into the the eighth car in the row. I pulled down the safety bar. The ride began. The roller coaster cars pulled around the corner @ORGANIZATION1 stopped. There were speakers on both sides of my head that i had not noticed until the moment sound began to come out of them. It was a mans voice @ORGANIZATION1 some background music. the voice did a count down form ten @ORGANIZATION1 the yelled "" blast off"" @ORGANIZATION1 the ride took of at high speeds. It was going so fast my face was being pushed back into a smile. The ride then slowly climbed to the top of a giant hill @ORGANIZATION1 plummeted to the bottom. There were so many twists @ORGANIZATION1 turns the ride even when upside down! when it came time to take the picture at the end I was crying I was laughing so hard. my sister @ORGANIZATION1 I exited the ride @ORGANIZATION1 walked over to the booth were they show the pictures that they had taken of the people on the ride. Both of our faces were priceless. We then road the ride five more times before heading back to the hotel for dinner. From that day on I was addicted to roller coasters, @ORGANIZATION1 have ridden many since."	36
21126	"When my friend @PERSON2 and I went to go hang out with our friends from @LOCATION1. We knew how would get there but we didn't know how we were going to get back, but knowing us we didn't care we just wanted to have fun. we had lot's of fun hanging out but then it started getting dark we needed a ride back home. Later on I decited to call my dad to see if he would come and get us. Knowing my dad he thought it was really funny that my friend and I were stuck in @LOCATION1, so he started laughing. After he was still laughing I asked so can you come get us cause its getting ready dark and he said no, cause it's not his fault that I was stuck there. So @PERSON2 said ""why don't I call my dad to see if he would"" and so she did but just like my dad he also started laughing and said no. Later on @PERSON2 and I ran out of people who to call. So we said to each other why don't we worry about his later it's really not that dark and we can all still hang out for a while longer. After i thought that throw I knew we should start worry about because later on it well get even more darker then it already is and then we diffidently wont have a ride home. So I told @PERSON2 that we should keep on trying people while we hang out with our friends more, but she didn't care so much. I made a call to my sister @PERSON1 to see if she would do me the favor of picking us up from @LOCATION1. I called and call her but she wouldn't pick up her phone. An hour past and we still couldn't think of someone, but then I thought to my self maybe my other sister @CAPS1 she always does favors for me, I called her and I asked her if she could and she said yes ill be there in @NUM1 minuets to pick you guys up. So I went to go tell @PERSON2 the great news that I got us a ride home and we don't have to worry about it anymore. When I went back to the park she wasn't there any more I thought she went to the bathroom, so I went to checked the bathroom for her but she was not there also. I thought to my self where could she of gone. I started to get really worried about were she went so I walked around and looked for her. So I looked at my clock and saw that my sister was going to be here in ten minuet, before I realized she was at the store getting food and she didn't tell me. I got really mad at her for not telling me where she went, but I thought to myself it didn't matter so why was I going to make a big deal about it and then I heard someone beep and it was my sister @CAPS1 I got really happy to see her cause all I thought of is going home and sleeping all night and all day. We got in the car and my sister asked why didn't I call my dad for a ride? I told her I did but he didn't want to pick me up because if I could get here then why couldn't get back home. She started laughing at me and thought it was the most funniest thing my dad has ever done. After we dropped of my friend @PERSON2, we went out to eat to burger king and got two salads to go. When I got home my dad asked who brought me and I told him my sister went and got me and took me out to eat. After being stuck in @LOCATION1 so long and not having a way to get I just went to my room and went to bed because it was a very long day for me and my pore little feet. The next morning I didn't wake up until @NUM2 in the @TIME1. My dad thought i need to wake up already so he went it my room and woke me up and told me i need to eat and get fresh air. I woke up and took a shower and eat some food and took a very short walk because my feet were still hurting from yesterday. when I went on my walk I was thinking about how I shouldn't of just gone to @LOCATION1 with out making sure I had a ride back home, but I was very thankful for my sister going out of her way to pick me up and not get mad or even yelled at me. when I got back home I called my sister and told her that I was really thankful for her going to go get me and my friend and even taking me out to eat."	27
21431	" Laughter plays an important role in everyone's lives. Different laughs represent various things. For instance, have @CAPS2 ever heard someone chuckle and know right away that they are being sarcastic, or maybe even sympathetic? A laugh can say a lot. I'm going to tell @CAPS2 about the time my friend fell into an @NUM1 pond.  In early @DATE1, my friend was visiting me at my house for a week. The third morning of her stay, we woke up and it had snowed seven inches @TIME1. I was used to the soft, white flakes spiraling through the air, @CAPS1 @CAPS1 was from @LOCATION1 and had never seen snow before. As my friend was listing all of the things @CAPS1 wanted to do that day, @CAPS1 let out the most anxious laugh I had ever heard. I could tell @CAPS1 just wanted to go outside that very moment. Of course @CAPS1 knew it was going to be cold but I didn't think @CAPS1 knew how cold. I told her it was going to be chillier than what @CAPS1 might be expecting.  We got dressed in numerous layers of clothing: socks, pants, shirts, and jackets so we could head out. As we were walking down the snowy hill @CAPS1 spotted the @NUM1 pond on the lower half of my property and hurled towards it. @CAPS1 asked if we could go swimming, I laughed a sarcastic laugh and answered, ""heck no!"" @CAPS1 walked toward a massive log that lays across the water and decided to cross it. @CAPS1 said that if I didn't go with her @CAPS1 would push me in. So I took a step back, @CAPS1 just looked down and continued walking. As @CAPS1 stepped onto the log that was glazed with ice @CAPS1 got a little cocky and decided to jump around to show me it was ""fun."" I laughed at the funny movements @CAPS1 was making and whispered, ""@CAPS2're going to fall."" All of a sudden @CAPS1 slipped and the ice cracked. It reminded me of glass shattering on a cement floor. This picture in front of me was almost as if it was in slow motion; I can remember her hands reaching up to grasp the log before @CAPS1 fell in to the freezing water. @CAPS1 fell through, I bounded @TIME1 to help her out, I slowly pulled her out of the pond. I looked at her after I had harpooned onto the log and we both burst out in laughter...although her teeth were chattering and her multiple layers of clothing we soaked, I knew @CAPS1 was @CAPS3 going to cherish this moment because it was her first snow experience.  Walking up to the house @CAPS1 giggled, ""I should have listened to @CAPS2 huh?"" I nodded my head and suggested we take off her clothes to ring out and put in the dryer.We changed into pajamas and sipped on hot chocolate and coffee all day long, sharing laughter and smiles. I will @CAPS3 remember this day because there were so many different stories I can tell from it."	40
21250	 I met my best friend, @PERSON1, in the third grade. Best friends are the people who come into your lives and stay with you for the rest of it, through the easy moments and the hard times. We learn from our best friends and share experiences with each other. No matter the distance, their friendship is always there for you, even if you are thousands of miles apart or just a few houses away. The laughter between two best friends is an element that bonds them for life, because when two friends truly laugh together, they will always have a small moment in their lives intertwined for as long as they live.  @PERSON1 and I have grown up together. We were there for each other from learning how to jump rope at school through broken bones, school-girl drama, crushes, boyfriends, heartbreaks, weddings and funerals. We helped each other get through everything from hard classes to family pets dying. We offered advice and brought hot chocolate, but this is only the beginning of our friendship. After the problems were solved, we learned how to laugh at our mistakes and move on. Together, we have gotten past slip-ups in what we say, to slipping on the floor. After we have giggled over what the other did or said, we helped them up and moved on. @PERSON1 and I know that, no matter what situation arises, we will always be there for each other, because we have the each others backs. @PERSON1 can make a joke out of any occasion. She is one of those friends that can make you smile just by seeing her face or hearing her voice. Most of the best moments in my life have usually involved @PERSON1 in some way. We have memories from lying in the driveway and watching the stars at night, to cracking up while working backstage for the local drama club. @PERSON1 can always crack me up with her perfect imitations of anyone, no matter how bad of a mood I am in. I crack @PERSON1 up all the time, usually unintentionally, by saying or doing something ridiculous, which shows my true blond side. We laugh over lines from our favorite movies and write down the funniest moments. We have shared so many memories together that we laugh over everything from driving around town and listening to music to being followed by the kiosk workers at the mall. One of the funniest times we ever spent around each other was while we worked backstage during a production by our local theater club. We laughed about everything from building sets to mistakes on stage. We had to open and close curtains in the dark, while wearing full black. I stubbed every single one of my toes that week while rolling the sets on and off stage. My hair was impossible to miss from the audience's point of view, even though I kept cramming it under a black ski hat. @PERSON1 would always have a problem opening one of the curtains that would get stuck when it was halfway open. She had to frantically tug on the rope even thought it kept getting caught in the pulley. I would laugh at her mistakes and she would laugh at mine. We both had a lot of fun watching the audience, director, and actors all at the same time. @PERSON1 and I got to stand in the back and watch all of the actors mistakes, giggling silently with each other. Every time one of the actors would make a mistake, we could watch the audience laugh and the director's face, which was usually horrified for a moment. Now whenever we mention any word or line from that play, we both start cracking up and remembering the entire weekend. There were more jokes then could ever be written down, and every time it is brought up, we remember even more funny moments.  When we are near each other, one quick look or a single word muttered under our breath can crack us both up. We can make each other laugh without even explaining what we meant, because we have shared so many experiences that we can read each others minds. Just one key expression or a twinkle in our eyes can crack the other up. Most other people around us probably would not even notice the small crinkle in the corner of our eyes or a slight smile. Those are the best codes ever imagined, because only the person that it is meant for could figure it out. The messages shared through the eyes a best friend can silently bring up subjects never spoken about and make us laugh. This is why true best friends are bonded by laughter, because it keeps them close no matter what comes, and for every moment of sadness, there are two moments of laughter and happiness.	44
20889	" Laughing, smirking, giggling, @CAPS1 chuckling; these all have to do with one subject, @CAPS1 that is, laughing. Laughter is everywhere, you hear it in libraries, parks, at home, behind your back, @CAPS1 it can be a great thing or a horrible thing in @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 even with family @CAPS1 friends. Everyone has a past with laughing that has welcomed them, helped them out, cheered them up, or even, just so they can make a very special friend that will stay with them forever. It was the start of a brand new @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 I had just moved from @LOCATION2. I was a seventh grader about to start at @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 wasn't a real big fan of hanging out with people , so i stayed to myself most of the weeks, eating lunch in the guidance center, trying to figure out where books where without talking to anybody. My schedule was good, I had choir, art, drama, you know all the stuff I like. Art @CAPS1 drama were a blast, but when it came to choir @CAPS1 singing, my social level went down. I love to sing, but never did it in front of people. Then one day, I was walking to choir @CAPS1 I tripped @CAPS1 fell, my papers falling with me. My @ORGANIZATION1 work was all over the hall, math at one end, science at the other. But, out of all the kids in the hallway, only one laughed. She walked by @CAPS1 say I did a great job but something triggered her to come back. She helped me pick up all my math homework @CAPS1 picked up my schedule @CAPS1 saw that she too had choir this period. Her name was @PERSON1, she told me, @CAPS1 i told her my name, @CAPS1 we walked together. We sat next to each other @CAPS1 i sang with her ours voices in harmony. We talked in between periods, at lunch, on the bus ride home. We became great friends @CAPS1 the principal thought so too @CAPS1 he went ahead @CAPS1 gave us classes together. We were friends @CAPS1 we still are friends till this day. But the sad thing is is that she moved at the near end of eighth grade year. But she was the only friend I had for a little while @CAPS1 I always give her a call every now @CAPS1 then. Sometimes we can talk for hours, laughing @CAPS1 talking about how we are doing @CAPS1 when we are going to see each other again. She has been my best friend for at least two years now @CAPS1 it all happened by a slip of a foot, that falling of papers, @CAPS1 one little laugh from an amazing person. Laughing has got me so far in life @CAPS1 at @ORGANIZATION1. Every now @CAPS1 then, when i see someone, all alone, wanting a friend, I go @CAPS1 talk to them, @CAPS1 even laugh with them. One little laugh can trigger a huge friendship waiting to happen. Even if you don't think so, it does. Some say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS1 I believe who ever said that because it happened to me."	40
