Some weights of the model checkpoint at klue/bert-base were not used when initializing DocumentBertCombineWordDocumentLinear: ['cls.predictions.decoder.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predictions.decoder.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DocumentBertCombineWordDocumentLinear from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DocumentBertCombineWordDocumentLinear from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of DocumentBertCombineWordDocumentLinear were not initialized from the model checkpoint at klue/bert-base and are newly initialized: ['mlp.1.weight', 'mlp.1.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (618 > 512). Running this sequence through the model will result in indexing errors
